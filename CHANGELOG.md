# Changelog

## 1.0.4

- Development baseline for the next 1.0.x maintenance release.
- Add an opt-out preference that makes each new Launcher session start in direct English input without changing the system keyboard layout or other applications.
- Advance settings schema to 12 for downgrade-safe persistence of the launcher input preference.
- Show all configured words for user shortcuts in launcher results (for example, `ts · teamspeak`) while keeping the first keyword authoritative for existing search/ranking behavior.

## 1.0.3

- Clean Asterun's owned `SendTo\\Asterun.lnk` registration during `Uninstall.exe` after verifying that the Shell Link resolves to the current portable `Asterun.exe` and uses the dedicated `--add-shortcut` action.
- Preserve same-named user shortcuts, foreign portable Asterun copies, malformed entries and unexpected filesystem objects instead of deleting by filename alone.
- Keep normal Asterun exit behavior unchanged; SendTo remains a persistent opt-in Shell integration until the user disables it or runs the uninstaller.
- Refresh the README settings preview with the current Asterun-branded interface.
- Preserve existing search, UI/runtime behavior and persisted data schemas outside this uninstall cleanup.

## 1.0.2

- Prevent secondary and forwarded instances from stopping the primary instance's managed Everything.
- Deliver background completion notifications through the UI dispatcher so modal dialogs cannot swallow them.
- Fix ListView subclass installation cleanup and Everything IPC timer failure completion.
- Make Everything downloads and update HTTP requests safely cancellable while retaining callback state until final handle closure.
- Release obsolete contextual search caches and prepared indices; load Classic bitmaps and DCs only on first Classic use and retain them for reuse.
- Remove duplicate synchronous search refreshes during ordinary launcher Show operations.
- Use a consistent available Chinese/Latin text font in Modern Compact and regular-weight result titles; preserve Classic typography and existing layout.
- Add targeted lifecycle, cancellation, cache, resource, DPI and input regression coverage.
- Preserve search matching/ranking, pinyin, Usage, numeric Quick Launch, Everything behavior, update/uninstall protocols and all data schemas.

## 1.0.1

- Replace the square-backed application/tray artwork with the approved transparent Asterun mark.
- Give Asterun a product-specific tray GUID so it can coexist with legacy ALTRun Next without notification-area identity collisions.
- Keep Asterun running when one or more startup global hotkeys are already occupied; show one concise warning instead of multiple dialogs.
- Retry tray registration after clearing a stale Asterun shell entry and restore the configured persistent icon after Explorer recreates the taskbar.
- Add Windows runtime coverage for the hotkey-conflict + tray-visibility regression.
- Retry transient GitHub update-check failures (HTTP 502/503/504) up to three attempts with short cancellation-aware delays, and replace raw gateway codes with a concise retry-later message.
- Make Modern Compact the default launcher style for new settings while preserving explicitly saved Classic choices.
- Present Windows startup notifications under the user-facing name `Asterun` instead of the internal publisher-qualified identity.
- Give `Update.exe` and `Uninstall.exe` distinct transparent Asterun-family icons so all three executables are visually distinguishable.


## 1.0.0

- Promote the validated v0.8 beta codebase directly to ALTRun Next 1.0.0 stable with no intentional search/ranking, shortcut, provider-ID or schema redesign.
- Ship the accepted Classic ALTRun and Modern Compact launcher experiences, smart numeric Quick Launch, pinyin/mixed-language search, Windows application discovery, shortcut management and portable data model as the first stable 1.x baseline.
- Harden managed Everything first acquisition, service ownership/repair, protected service hosting, tray behavior and uninstall cleanup while preserving external/user-managed Everything installations.
- Harden configuration backup recovery, archive extraction, secure elevation, update apply/rollback, reparse handling and release artifact integrity.
- Keep the portable archive minimal: ALTRunNext.exe, Update.exe, Uninstall.exe, VERSION, README.md, runtime dictionaries and required third-party notices.
- Give Update.exe and Uninstall.exe dedicated branded icon variants while preserving the original ALTRun application icon for the main executable.
- Preserve Settings schema 11, Commands schema 2, Usage schema 2 and Provider Cache schema 22 for compatibility with the validated beta line.
- Publish Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion `1.0.0.30000`.

## 0.8.0-beta.3

- Preserve a healthy configuration backup when the primary JSON has invalid command/settings/usage semantics; report failed repairs instead of overwriting recoverable data.
- Report incomplete updater rollback and retain protected recovery files for a retry.
- Extract ZIP archives synchronously with CRC, size, member-path and cancellation checks; publish managed Everything only after staging succeeds.
- Verify the Everything service-host executable's trusted voidtools signature before promoting a copied source.
- Cache resolved folder templates per index generation and folder; replace the pinyin cache's linear eviction scan with an LRU list.
- Select only the requested top search results while retaining stable tie order; persist usage evidence on a coalesced background worker with a final flush, retire long-absent automatic entries, and remove deleted user-command history.
- Propagate cancellation through provider scans and convert unexpected background exceptions into failed update/Everything status instead of process termination.
- Share SHA-256 file hashing and Windows command-line quoting; compile the application implementation once for both the product and real-window tests.
- Split settings-page layout and update coordination into focused translation units without changing UI behavior.
- Pin dependency downloads by SHA-256 and ship miniz's license.
- Replace historical release-contract branches with a current, fail-closed security and package gate.
- Publish Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion `0.8.0.10003`.

## 0.8.0-beta.2

- Keep the v0.8 product/UI/search surface frozen; this release changes only security, update transaction, release automation and associated tests.
- Replace predictable PID/tick elevated Update/Uninstall temporary executables with cryptographically random dedicated worker directories guarded against write/delete/path replacement through UAC process creation.
- Guard Everything service elevation against executable/directory replacement without changing managed/external ownership semantics.
- Reject HTTPS-to-HTTP redirect downgrade in the native update client.
- Replace the updater's ad-hoc file journal with a shared transaction implementation that tracks newly created directories, preserves `data`, rejects reparse traversal and rolls back only changes introduced by the current transaction.
- Keep the manifest-verified update ZIP through handoff; protected-folder updates re-lock and re-hash the archive after UAC, then re-extract into a random work/staging tree inherited from the protected install root before elevated apply.
- Restore a split managed Everything topology for the privilege boundary: the standard-user client stays portable under `data/tools/Everything`, while the persistent service ImagePath is migrated to a protected Program Files service host obtained from the Windows Known Folder API. External Everything services remain untouched.
- Add `update_runtime_tests` covering successful apply/rollback, personal-data preservation, deterministic mid-apply failure cleanup and reparse-source rejection.
- Replace the updater health-event NULL DACL with a current-user signal ACL and use a cryptographically random event token.
- Unify automatic-main and explicit-tag versioned releases behind one immutable publish script that requires x64/ARM64 ZIPs, SHA256SUMS and `update-manifest.json`, publishes through a draft boundary and verifies the public manifest endpoint.
- Make all versioned SemVer tags immutable, including prereleases; `dev-latest` remains the only intentionally movable tag.
- Reduce GitHub Actions default permission to `contents: read`; only release publication jobs receive `contents: write`.
- Keep Settings 11 / Commands 2 / Usage 2 / Provider Cache 22 unchanged.
- Publish Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion `0.8.0.10002`.

## 0.8.0-beta.1

- Enter the v0.8 product-freeze phase with no new feature surface, provider semantics, search/ranking behavior, schema migration or intentional Classic/Modern redesign.
- Freeze the accepted alpha.5.49 Classic baseline and alpha.6.4 Modern Compact presentation/interaction baseline behind a Beta release contract.
- Keep Settings schema 11 / Commands 2 / Usage 2 / Provider Cache 22 unchanged.
- Extend update-order coverage through `0.8.0-alpha.6.4 -> 0.8.0-beta.1 -> 0.8.0-rc.1`.
- Add a dedicated packaged `V0.8_BETA_VALIDATION.md` matrix covering Windows 10/11, x64/ARM64, mixed DPI, IME, Everything lifecycle, update/rollback, uninstall/recovery and resource-soak sign-off.
- Align tagged-release Windows smoke coverage with pull-request CI, adding launch-target/path portability, user-command path update, Everything lifecycle, update policy, upgrade matrix, feedback, uninstall recovery and window-presentation regressions.
- Require the v0.8 Beta validation matrix in the exact portable-package allowlist.
- Publish Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion `0.8.0.10001`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.6.4

- Freeze the accepted alpha.6.3 Modern Compact appearance; no new visual surface, animation, icon slot or setting is introduced.
- Keep the Modern shell from transiently collapsing while an Everything query is pending: synchronous results may expand the shell immediately, but shrinkage waits until the matching dynamic reply settles.
- Preserve asynchronous selection intent: a surviving selected identity follows its reordered row, while a removed identity clamps to the nearest valid row instead of jumping to the first result.
- Keep Modern row-count changes on a no-erase parent repaint path while native EDIT/LISTBOX children retain their own paint ownership.
- Keep the search EDIT as Modern's typing destination after mouse result selection, so a click can change the selected result without making the next keystroke fall into LISTBOX type-to-select behavior.
- Add portable interaction helpers and regression coverage for pending-row stability, selection fallback and every 1–10-row DPI height transition.
- Extend update-order coverage through alpha.6.4 while preserving the shared smart numeric Quick Launch implementation and the `1–9,0` Modern affordance.
- Preserve frozen Classic assets and shared SearchEngine / RelevancePolicy / ResultRanking / Everything / usage / numeric-intent behavior.
- Preserve Settings schema 11 / Commands 2 / Usage 2 / Provider Cache 22.
- Publish Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion `0.8.0.274`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.6.3

- Introduce the first full Modern Compact visual system instead of a single mostly-white canvas.
- Resize Modern Compact dynamically from search-only through one to ten result rows; preserve the previous height while an empty static pass is still awaiting Everything.
- Separate search, results and footer into distinct rounded surfaces over a cooler outer background.
- Add a lightweight painted search glyph while retaining the native EDIT control.
- Replace the fixed right-hand alias column with measured inline secondary metadata.
- Add a compact footer context surface and right-aligned `Enter` affordance.
- Request the Windows 11 DWM system backdrop when supported; keep the solid surface palette as the Windows 10/unsupported fallback.
- Tighten the Modern search surface from 42 to 38 logical pixels and settle on one DPI-scaled 14-logical-pixel Segoe UI search font. Windows font linking supplies Han glyphs without switching the whole EDIT font, so mixed Latin/CJK input no longer changes the preceding Latin text mid-query.
- Prefer Segoe Fluent Icons for the search glyph on Windows 11, with Segoe MDL2 Assets fallback on Windows 10; bind the glyph raster size directly to the DPI-scaled icon box instead of tuning for one display scale.
- Use Segoe UI + natural ClearType for Modern launcher text even when the application UI language is Chinese, leaving Windows font linking to supply CJK glyphs.
- Restore cyclic Tab / Up / Down result navigation in Modern Compact.
- Restore the shared smart numeric quick-launch behavior in Modern Compact. The selected row keeps the lighter hooked-return action glyph on the right; unselected rows use 12 pt muted chevron + digit hints with a fixed 3-logical-pixel gap (`› 1`-`› 9`, `› 0`) so the shortcut reads as an action rather than punctuation; the footer Enter affordance is unchanged.
- Remove the permanent Settings `WS_VSCROLL` creation style and hard-clear native scroll state when switching to non-scroll pages, with a real-HWND small-window regression.
- Make Everything enable/disable visual updates atomic and local: provider rows no longer pulse disabled, provider setters can suppress Settings-wide refresh callbacks, and only the changing Everything card is repainted instead of flashing unchanged Start Menu / Windows Apps / App Paths / PATH text.
- Restore minimized Settings/About and Shortcut Manager windows under a DWM cloak, synchronously repainting before uncloak so taskbar restores do not expose an intermediate frame.
- Embed a PerMonitorV2 manifest in `Uninstall.exe` so TaskDialog/MessageBox text is rendered at native monitor DPI instead of DPI-virtualized and blurry.
- Localize the Launcher style choices with the interface language: Chinese now shows `经典 ALTRun` / `现代紧凑`, while English keeps `Classic ALTRun` / `Modern Compact`.
- Preserve frozen Classic assets and shared search/Everything/usage/numeric-intent behavior.
- Publish Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion `0.8.0.273`.


## 0.8.0-alpha.6.2

- Rework Modern Compact result hierarchy after the first real-Windows visual pass: application display name is primary; alias/search identity becomes muted secondary metadata.
- Keep file/folder names primary and show parent paths as secondary context; suppress duplicate secondary labels.
- Remove the boxed result panel and per-row table separators.
- Add inset rounded selection treatment with a narrow accent marker while preserving native LISTBOX behavior.
- Keep one soft rounded search surface instead of nested hard frames.
- Reduce Modern auxiliary/footer typography to 9 pt and label footer values as Path / Command / Action / App (including Chinese labels).
- Preserve the alpha.5.49 frozen Classic/shared search core and alpha.6.1 native-control/DPI foundation.
- Publish Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion `0.8.0.272`.


## 0.8.0-alpha.6.1

- Start the dedicated Modern Compact refinement track after the accepted alpha.5.49 Classic freeze.
- Replace scattered Modern Compact layout literals with one DPI-aware geometry contract covering search, result surface, footer and row text columns.
- Lock Modern Compact geometry at 96/120/144/168/192 DPI in portable UI foundation tests.
- Keep native EDIT/LISTBOX interaction semantics while removing legacy `WS_BORDER` and `WS_EX_STATICEDGE` chrome from the Modern surface.
- Paint flat Modern search/results/client frames in the parent and cache row-selection/separator GDI resources instead of allocating them per draw.
- Preserve frozen Classic assets and shared SearchEngine / Everything / usage-ranking / numeric-intent semantics; schemas remain Settings 11 / Commands 2 / Usage 2 / Provider Cache 22.
- Publish Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion `0.8.0.271`.


## 0.8.0-alpha.5.49

- Force a real non-client frame recalculation after Settings page switches so the General-page scrollbar cannot remain visually ghosted on the first Search Sources visit. Show the managed Everything tray-icon control only when the live default IPC endpoint is actually owned by ALTRun Next's managed Everything process; merely having an install candidate/path no longer qualifies. Collapse unavailable controls and size the file-search card from its visible content, including bottom padding.
- Release the original uninstaller's working directory before elevation and let the Explorer broker exit before the worker acquires the root deletion handle. Supervise the broker with the worker process lifetime rather than a fixed pre-cleanup timeout; clear a read-only root through its validated handle and report the failed uninstall stage.
- Add Windows regressions for repeated search-source page visits, a broker-held directory handle, and a read-only installation root. Build #634 and the alpha.5.49 real-desktop closeout passed; Classic is technically frozen after this acceptance.

- Begin the Classic technical closeout while preserving the frozen Classic geometry.
- Stop copying the complete Command catalog on ordinary Launcher searches. The immutable CommandStore catalog is now consumed through a non-owning span; a context-resolved working copy is materialized only when at least one user shortcut actually uses `{folder}`.
- Prepare normalized query state and pinyin eligibility once per static search, and reuse normalized-query matching in relevance and dynamic filesystem ranking. File-stem matching now uses a non-owning view instead of allocating a temporary string.
- Avoid additional hot-path allocations by reusing the already-normalized single-term query instead of building a token vector, caching whether any user shortcut needs the contextual `{folder}` working set outside the keypress path, sampling recency time once per empty-query search, and passing the known query-empty state into result rebuilding instead of rereading the EDIT control.
- Make pinyin cache hits allocation-free through transparent lookup, move derived syllable strings into cache storage instead of copying them, and return the cache bucket array as well as entries when pinyin search is disabled.
- Lower background refresh memory peaks by moving provider-discovery command vectors into the cache update instead of deep-copying the full discovered catalog.
- Replace UsageStore's full-history rollback copy on every successful launch with a targeted undo log for only the selected command and affected same-query competitors; Clear likewise moves the map aside and restores it only if persistence fails.
- Bound the derived pinyin-form cache with an LRU-style capacity of 4096 entries so provider refreshes and long-running user-edit churn cannot grow it without limit.
- Extend the real Win32 runtime regression with a repeated Shortcut Manager -> Editor -> Path Conversion lifecycle soak and assert that GDI, USER and process-handle counts do not grow per cycle.
- Remove the optional search-result icon feature end to end: Settings preference/UI, Launcher HICON worker/cache/async message/rendering branches, LauncherResult icon metadata, ResultIconPipeline and its dedicated test target are gone. Legacy `showResultIcons` JSON is ignored and dropped on the next save without a schema bump.
- Fix Everything/CJK relevance admission: the 1-2 character strong-match precision gate now applies only to ASCII. A two-character CJK query such as `男主` can match the middle of `系统男主`, while short ASCII noise protection remains unchanged.
- Overfetch a bounded Everything candidate pool before ALTRun Next applies its own relevance filter/ranking, then trim back to the requested candidate count. This prevents broad short queries such as `v2` from being emptied by provider-side truncation before a strong result such as `v2rayN.exe` is seen.
- Preserve Settings schema 11, Commands 2, Usage 2 and Provider Cache 22; Windows fixed version `0.8.0.219`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.48

- Follow-up after real-desktop feedback: preserve hidden Settings visibility through page/hotkey redraw batches; `WM_SETREDRAW(TRUE)` previously exposed General before the explicit reveal and could bypass final placement.
- Transfer foreground permission from the external Add Shortcut forwarding process to the resident instance; ignore hidden/minimized owners for popup placement and do not reactivate a hidden Launcher or re-enable an already-disabled modal owner on close.
- Allow repeated selections to reorder comparable initials matches; exact name, explicit shortcut, surface and field priority remain protected. Bound and decay same-query preference evidence so saturated history can adapt, without changing Usage schema 2 or global launch counts.
- Add real-HWND Settings/About/editor runtime regressions to both Windows validation jobs, plus search/persistence/ordering regressions. Mixed-monitor rendering and Explorer foreground behavior still require interactive sign-off.
- Remove successful Launcher execution feedback entirely; ordinary, packaged and numeric/delayed launches no longer play Popup.wav.
- Keep sound feedback only for startup notification, hidden-to-visible Launcher reveal and genuine application failure paths.
- Defer tray menu commands until after the `TrackPopupMenu` modal loop and tray callback unwind, eliminating a foreground-owner bounce when opening Settings, About or Shortcut Manager.
- Reveal hidden top-level windows without activation under the existing DWM cloak, then perform one explicit foreground handoff after the fully painted frame is visible.
- Prepare the About page before Settings becomes visible instead of revealing General first and switching pages afterward.
- Keep Settings schema 11, Commands 2, Usage 2 and Provider Cache 22; Windows fixed version `0.8.0.218`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.47

- Move startup-registration and SendTo reconciliation off the first-frame path; the real launcher window/health signal is established before Shell integration work begins.
- Reconcile shell integrations on a background COM worker with desired-state guards so a concurrent Settings change wins deterministically.
- Make the HKCU Run registration idempotent and avoid rewriting an unchanged value.
- Load and compare the existing SendTo Shell Link before saving; an unchanged portable install performs no .lnk rewrite, while a moved install still self-repairs target/working-directory/icon paths.
- Extend packaged x64 runtime smoke with a 3-second first-frame health contract and a repeat-launch no-rewrite assertion.
- Keep Settings schema 11, Commands 2, Usage 2 and Provider Cache 22; Windows fixed version `0.8.0.217`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.46

- Simplify the native tray menu to Show launcher, Shortcut Manager…, Settings…, About and Exit; remove Reload and group management entries together.
- Make Show launcher the native default menu item and display the effective enabled hotkeys for Show launcher, Shortcut Manager and Settings.
- Default Start with Windows, Add to Send To menu and Numeric quick launch to on for fresh settings and Restore defaults.
- Preserve existing persisted user choices and the historical off baseline when upgrading older settings that did not yet carry these fields.
- Keep Settings schema 11, Commands 2, Usage 2 and Provider Cache 22; Windows fixed version `0.8.0.216`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.45

- Set the explicit process AppUserModelID to `Aspeternity.ALTRunNext` so portable shell-facing surfaces share one stable product identity.
- Give the notification-area icon a stable GUID, preserve the standard tooltip under `NOTIFYICON_VERSION_4`, and accept keyboard selection while retaining double-click activation.
- Restore only the persistent tray icon after Explorer/taskbar restart; do not resurrect one-shot startup-notification icons.
- Use the authorized original ALTRun `MAINICON` / `Res/Carracho.ico` for the executable, top-level product windows and tray icon.
- Replace the temporary generated alpha.5.44 tones with the authorized original ALTRun `Popup.wav` while preserving the existing sound toggle and feedback policy.
- Preserve Settings schema 11, Commands 2, Usage 2 and Provider Cache 22; Windows fixed version `0.8.0.215`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.44

- Share shortcut deletion confirmation, canonical display name, cancel default, and failure handling across Launcher and Shortcut Manager.
- Add General sound preference (default on, no preview button) with transactional persistence, schema-10 migration and schema-11 downgrade protection.
- Add original embedded startup/reveal/execute/failure PCM cues with asynchronous playback, duplicate suppression and immediate mute.
- Route application prompts through silent native dialogs and consume translated launcher control characters to prevent default edit beeps. Canceling UAC is silent.
- Preserve Classic geometry and search behavior. Commands schema 2, Usage schema 2, Provider Cache schema 22; Windows fixed version `0.8.0.214`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.43

- Learn bounded usage per successful query and command. `s` and `st` no longer transfer ranking preference to one another; global history remains for empty queries.
- Preserve the query snapshot across delayed numeric execution; migrate schema-1 usage counts to schema 2 without inventing old query associations.
- During provider merge, suppress an App Paths executable inside a WindowsApps package only when the enabled packaged provider exposes the matching family and publisher AUMID. Leave unrelated App Paths entries and explicit user shortcuts intact.
- Provider Cache stays at schema 22; Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.213`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.42

- Apply a bounded, frequency-only usage bonus to comparable search matches after at least two launches; preserve stronger match kinds, surfaces and fields.
- Preserve empty-query recency ordering and explicit syntax/path behavior. No new usage or Provider Cache schema is needed, and search remains cache-only.
- Add regressions for a single launch, repeated launches, the bonus cap and stronger-intent precedence.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.212`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.41

- Corroborate opaque utility-container entries whose resolved executable belongs to a matching suite-owned Windows Common Files directory, even if the clear primary is installed on another drive.
- Require the suite owner in the immediate Common Files child directory; unrelated vendors, merely nested family words, non-utility menu entries and longer independent companions stay Normal.
- Rebuild Provider Cache at schema 22. Preserve the existing cache-only explicit-intent SearchEngine rules.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.211`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.40

- Extend opaque auxiliary corroboration beyond generic Tools/Utilities folders without introducing product vocabulary.
- A short family-stripped identity remains non-suppressive by itself; publication now requires the same catalog context, a clear High-confidence primary, and a resolved target that is either a same-directory sidecar or a shallow descendant of the primary install directory.
- Preserve opaque entries in unrelated install trees and longer independent companions as Normal.
- Multi-token search now reuses already-cached distinctive identity when ordinary token matching fails, so an exact short residual such as generic `Q7` works in both `q7` and `acme studio q7` without reopening global one/two-character BoundaryPrefix recall.
- StrongMatchOnly distinctive prefixes remain protected by the family/distinctive admission boundary.
- Provider Cache advances to schema 21 so stale schema-20 Normal role decisions rebuild under the new publication-time structural rule.
- SearchEngine remains cache-only and I/O-free; Classic UI/geometry and ResultRanking are unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.210`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.39

- Separate shared family intent from entry-owned distinctive intent at the final StrongMatchOnly admission boundary.
- A query whose compact text is contained by the cached catalog family cannot re-admit a StrongMatchOnly entry through a contaminated/shared distinctive token.
- Explicit residual identity remains intact: short exact identities such as generic Q7/Rx-style tokens and family-plus-identity queries still re-admit the restrictive entry.
- Normal primary/companion applications remain unaffected by the StrongMatchOnly gate, and wildcard/explicit syntax behavior is unchanged.
- The guard is cache-only string matching over catalogGroupKey; no filesystem, Shell/MSI, executable metadata or role inference moves into the keystroke path.
- Provider Cache remains schema 20 because the persisted command contract is unchanged.
- Add regressions with deliberately family-contaminated distinctive tokens so short/full family queries stay suppressed while explicit distinctive queries continue to work.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.209`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.38

- Add conservative opaque auxiliary corroboration for short family-stripped identities; short naming alone never changes admission.
- Treat executable ProductName as an independent strength-2 semantic field only for opaque identities, allowing a second metadata field to corroborate generic Diagnostic/Repair/Updater/etc. semantics without making ProductName alone suppressive.
- In an already corroborated Tools/Utilities/工具 container, allow a short opaque entry to become SuiteUtility when its real target is a shallow descendant of the clear primary application's install directory.
- Preserve unrelated short entries whose real target lives outside the primary install tree.
- Keep explicit opaque identity tokens so a restrictive entry can still be recovered by its own short name.
- Add metadata corroboration, shallow-install-tree, distant-tree false-positive and SearchEngine re-admission regressions.
- Exact precomputed distinctive tokens now act as explicit identity for any entry, while StrongMatchOnly entries additionally accept distinctive-token prefixes; short opaque identities remain directly reachable without restoring broad family-query recall.
- Provider Cache advances to schema 20; ResultRanking and frozen Classic UI/geometry remain unchanged, and SearchEngine adds only cache-resident distinctive-token matching with no new I/O or catalog inference.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.208`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.37

- Treat sibling Start Menu `Tools` / `Utilities` / `工具` folders as structural utility-container evidence instead of product-specific vocabulary.
- Normalize only the catalog group family by removing a terminal generic utility-container token, allowing a tools folder to correlate with a clear sibling suite primary while preserving the original menu location and display identity.
- Require a related High-confidence non-utility primary before utility-container evidence can suppress anything.
- Promote a utility-container entry only when a second signal agrees: generic management/utility semantics or a resolved executable sidecar in the primary install directory.
- Add weak contextual library-management semantics, including Simplified Chinese equivalents; isolated entries remain Low/Normal until catalog corroboration exists.
- Preserve independent entries in utility folders when they have their own installed subdirectory and no generic utility semantics.
- Merge family-stripped residual identity into SuiteUtility/DiagnosticTool/SuiteSubordinate explicit intent so users can re-admit a restrictive entry by its own distinguishing word.
- Preserve only contextual residual identity that is not already covered by the semantic role phrase and not shared with a normal peer, preventing a parent companion token from re-admitting a restrictive child on a family/companion query.
- Add fictional English/Chinese utility-folder, sidecar, library-manager, independent-subdirectory and no-primary regressions plus SearchEngine re-admission coverage.
- Provider Cache advances to schema 19; SearchEngine/ResultRanking and frozen Classic UI/geometry are unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.207`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.36

- Resolve Windows Installer advertised Start Menu shortcuts to their installed component path for discovery evidence using `MsiGetShortcutTargetW` + `MsiGetComponentPathW`.
- Keep launch behavior unchanged: Start Menu commands still execute the original `.lnk` via ShellItem; only canonical identity, metadata and catalog evidence use the installed target.
- MSI resolution is side-effect free: no feature-use, configure, repair, provide-component or installation call is made during discovery.
- Replace metadata-sensitive suite title identity with catalog-family-stripped display-title identity.
- Generalize suite target corroboration to executable-stem extension or a nearby sibling install-directory-segment extension.
- Parse cached canonical file identities with Windows separator semantics independent of the host OS, so Linux core CI exercises the same directory topology as Windows runtime discovery.
- Preserve conservative admission: title containment alone, shared family alone or an unrelated target does not produce `SuiteSubordinate`.
- Add regressions for normal non-advertised shortcuts, executable-stem topology, directory-segment topology, metadata-token drift and title-only false positives.
- Provider Cache advances to schema 18.
- SearchEngine/ResultRanking and frozen Classic UI/geometry are unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.206`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.35

- Added a provider-neutral `SuiteSubordinate` catalog role for child launch surfaces inside multi-entry application suites.
- Topology calibration requires two independent parent/child signals in the same catalog context: the family-stripped display identity must strictly extend a normal companion, and the resolved executable stem must strictly extend that companion's executable stem.
- Shared family membership, title containment alone and opaque one-off companion names do not trigger suppression.
- Medium-confidence suite subordinates use `StrongMatchOnly`; their cached distinctive intent is reduced to the child-only delta so a parent/family query does not re-admit the child while explicit child intent still does.
- Added fictional parent/child suite regressions covering base companions, child surfaces, title-only false positives and unrelated one-off companions.
- SearchEngine/RelevancePolicy/ResultRanking remain unchanged; topology calibration is I/O-free publication-time work.
- Provider Cache advances to schema 17.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.205`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.34

- Completed Start Menu launch-surface evidence for Windows shell shortcuts whose user-facing destination is carried by broker activation semantics instead of a direct filesystem target.
- Shell-link inspection now preserves the PIDL desktop-absolute parsing name even when GetPath() returns a broker executable.
- Discovery recognizes trusted Windows-directory control.exe and mmc.exe surfaces, Control_RunDLL/.cpl invocations, ms-settings URIs, direct Shell namespaces and explorer-hosted namespace activation as SystemUtility evidence.
- Broker executable recognition is path-constrained to the Windows directory; an unrelated executable with the same leaf name is not reclassified.
- Start Menu surface refinement now considers publication path, resolved target path, PIDL parsing path and shell activation semantics before caching surfaceClass.
- SearchEngine, RelevancePolicy and ResultRanking remain I/O-free and unchanged on the keystroke path.
- Rolling dev-latest verification now uses authenticated release-state checks plus the exact anonymous manifest asset consumed by clients, avoiding false CI failures from shared-runner unauthenticated GitHub API rate limits while preserving Draft/public/coherence guarantees.
- Provider Cache advances to schema 16 so alpha.5.33 cached surface classes rebuild once.
- Catalog Role/Visibility, short-query precision, usage, pinyin, Everything and frozen Classic UI/geometry are unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.204`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.33

- Added a dedicated Short Query Precision policy for 1-2 character ASCII queries without changing longer-query behavior.
- Exact matches, whole-field prefixes, explicit aliases/user shortcuts, derived initials and pinyin remain available at 1-2 characters.
- Generic later-word BoundaryPrefix recall now requires at least 3 ASCII characters, preventing short queries from surfacing unrelated words such as Admin / Advanced / Additional / Sources inside otherwise unrelated entries.
- Three-character boundary-prefix queries continue to work, preserving fast partial-word discovery once the query is specific enough.
- Start Menu surface classification now considers both the shortcut publication path and its resolved target path. A root-level shortcut that points into Windows/Administrative/System/Developer tool locations can therefore inherit SystemUtility/DeveloperTool semantics.
- The resolved-target refinement happens only during provider discovery; the keystroke path gains no I/O or catalog work.
- Provider Cache advances to schema 15 so cached Start Menu surface classes are rebuilt under the resolved-target structural model.
- Catalog Role, CatalogVisibility, ResultRanking, usage, pinyin, Everything, provider monitoring and frozen Classic UI/geometry are unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.203`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.32

- Completed another provider-neutral layer of residual suite-utility evidence for management/monitoring surfaces that should be reachable explicitly but should not accompany a plain suite-family query.
- Added weak contextual SuiteUtility phrases for network monitoring, license/licensing management/administration/utilities, and user-facing service management/administration/console/utility surfaces, including Simplified Chinese equivalents.
- These residual phrases remain Low/Normal in isolation and require a related clear suite primary before becoming Medium/StrongMatchOnly; standalone applications named Network Monitor or Service Manager are therefore not hidden by title alone.
- User-facing Service Manager/Service Console/Service Utility titles no longer lose to generic ServiceComponent text evidence merely because the word “service” is present.
- Catalog context may repair a Start Menu management surface that provider metadata initially labeled BackgroundComponent or ServiceComponent, but only when the title carries a known contextual utility phrase and a related primary application exists.
- True service/background entries such as Service Host remain service/background roles; nearby independent companions such as Network Designer remain Normal.
- Restrictive query intent now includes the same network/license/service-management phrases, so explicit monitor/license/service searches can re-admit the utility without restoring shared family intent.
- Provider Cache advances to schema 14 to rebuild alpha.5.31 role/token state under the residual evidence model.
- Routing, Player, Boost, opaque short names and other ambiguous entries remain intentionally unclassified without stronger generic evidence.
- SearchEngine, ResultRanking, usage, pinyin, Everything, provider monitoring and frozen Classic UI/geometry are unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.202`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.31

- Added provider-neutral `SuiteUtility` for user-invoked suite auxiliaries such as task/job schedulers, synchronization managers/tools, automation utilities and maintenance consoles.
- High-information utility phrases classify directly at Medium confidence; ambiguous single words such as Sync/Scheduler/Automation/Maintenance stay Low/Normal until corroborated by a related suite primary.
- Weak ASCII utility cues use token-aware matching, so unrelated words such as `async` cannot accidentally trigger `sync`.
- `AlternateLaunch` relationship inference no longer requires strict same-group/location context. A variant can be corroborated by the same canonical activation target, the same normalized family, or a title base that matches a clear primary application.
- Same canonical target gives High-confidence AlternateLaunch; family/title-base corroboration gives Medium. An isolated Quick Launch/Safe Mode phrase remains Low/Normal.
- Diagnostic evidence now recognizes generic problem-report/support/recovery/diagnostic-assistant metadata without any product-name rule. Opaque metadata-driven diagnostic/utility entries keep only their family-stripped entry-name intent so they remain explicitly searchable.
- Independent Composer/Renderer/Editor/Encoder-style companions remain Normal; a weak `Sync` companion becomes StrongMatchOnly only with suite-primary context.
- Provider Cache advances to schema 13 to rebuild alpha.5.30 role/token state under the completed Alternate/SuiteUtility model.
- SearchEngine, ResultRanking, usage, pinyin, Everything, provider monitoring and frozen Classic UI/geometry are unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.201`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.30

- Fixed the rolling `dev-latest` release path that could leave a GitHub Draft Release behind while CI still reported success, causing installed prerelease clients to receive HTTP 404 for `update-manifest.json`.
- Development-release concurrency no longer cancels a publish in progress. Queued stale runs are rejected by main-SHA checks instead, preventing interruption during GitHub release creation/upload.
- The publish step re-checks `origin/main` immediately before mutating `dev-latest`, so an older green build cannot overwrite a newer main commit after waiting in the release queue.
- Existing `dev-latest` releases, including orphan drafts, are discovered through the authenticated Releases collection and repaired in place rather than relying on tag-based deletion that cannot reliably address drafts.
- Rolling assets are replaced with the manifest uploaded last, preserving a coherent client contract during publication.
- Bootstrap publication explicitly creates a draft and then explicitly PATCHes `draft=false`; both bootstrap and reuse paths finish with an explicit public/prerelease state update.
- CI now verifies the authenticated release state, `dev-latest` tag SHA, local manifest version/commit, the anonymous public Release API endpoint, and the exact anonymous manifest download URL used by installed clients.
- The downloaded public manifest must byte-match the locally generated manifest. A Draft/404/stale/mismatched rolling release now turns CI red instead of producing a false green build.
- Provider Cache remains schema 12; launcher search/catalog behavior is unchanged from alpha.5.29.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.200`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.29

- Hardened the entire launch-role evidence pipeline after real-machine validation showed that alpha.5.28 could still leave suite auxiliaries visible for a shared family prefix.
- Start Menu suite structure is now first-class family evidence rather than a fallback used only when EXE ProductName is empty. Helper executables may carry unrelated ProductName values without splitting one installed suite into unrelated catalog groups.
- When a reliable Start Menu suite folder exists, a helper EXE ProductName can no longer expand the shared family identity and consume legitimate companion names such as Composer, Renderer, Editor or Encoder.
- High-information title phrases now outrank generic title/ProductName primary-app identity while remaining Medium confidence when title is the only evidence. A helper whose own ProductName equals its Performance Test or Settings Wizard title no longer becomes a Normal PrimaryApplication.
- Distinctive title residuals and restrictive query intent are separated. StrongMatchOnly/Hidden roles now persist only explicit semantic role intent; arbitrary family/title residuals cannot reopen them through a short product prefix.
- Catalog grouping now uses a normalized family key. Start Menu entries prefer the suite folder plus menu location; non-Start-Menu providers fall back to normalized ProductName plus install root.
- Catalog publication adds an I/O-free title-evidence normalization pass before group context. Explicit high-information roles are repaired even if provider metadata previously labeled them Primary/Companion/Unknown.
- Weak role words still require a related family/location with a clear primary app. AlternateLaunch remains contextual; independent companion apps remain Normal.
- Provider Cache advances to schema 12 so schema-11 ProductName-centric family/group/token decisions rebuild once on upgrade.
- SearchEngine, ResultRanking, usage scoring, pinyin, Everything, provider monitoring and frozen Classic UI/geometry remain unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.199`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.28

- Fixed a catalog-intent isolation bug where a `StrongMatchOnly` entry could still be admitted by a short shared-family prefix when Windows exposed family + version + role as one contiguous title token.
- `BuildDistinctiveTokens()` now removes family identity even when it is embedded at the beginning of a contiguous token, rather than only removing whole tokens that exactly equal a family word.
- Known family version tokens and likely four-digit version/year affixes are stripped from the residual token after family removal, so entries such as generic `Contoso性能测试2025` persist role intent instead of `Contoso...` family intent.
- Semantic role phrases are appended only after family stripping, preserving explicit performance/settings/quick-launch intent for CJK and compact Windows shortcut titles.
- SearchEngine admission logic is unchanged; the fix restores the intended invariant that cached `distinctiveTokens` contain entry-specific intent rather than shared family identity.
- Provider Cache schema advances to 11 so schema-10 contaminated tokens from alpha.5.27 are rebuilt once on upgrade.
- Added generic compact-family regressions for CJK, no-space English and version-interleaved alternate-launch titles, plus an end-to-end SearchEngine regression proving a two-letter family prefix no longer re-admits a `StrongMatchOnly` entry while explicit role intent and exact full-title queries still work.
- No product-specific rule or blacklist was added; Classic UI/geometry, ResultRanking, usage, pinyin, Everything and provider monitoring are unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.198`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.27

- Calibrated launch-role evidence without adding any product-specific blacklist or SearchEngine rule.
- High-information title phrases such as performance/benchmark tests, settings/configuration wizards, diagnostics, updaters, download managers and their Chinese equivalents now provide at least Medium-confidence role evidence; ambiguous single words remain conservative.
- Added cross-entry catalog context at catalog publication: a weak auxiliary role can rise to Medium only when a related product/location group already contains a clear primary application.
- Added `ApplicationRole::AlternateLaunch` for suite convenience/variant entries such as Quick Launch, Safe Mode and no-plugins launchers. Group context is required; matching the primary activation target or carrying arguments strengthens confidence.
- Independent companion applications remain `Normal`; grouping is evidence and never collapses a suite to one executable.
- Added semantic distinctive-intent tokens for contiguous CJK/role phrases so `StrongMatchOnly` entries remain explicitly searchable without doing semantic work while typing.
- Context calibration runs on a transient provider snapshot during catalog publication. Provider Cache stores base discovery evidence, so enable/disable/refresh changes cannot leave stale contextual promotions behind.
- Provider Cache schema is bumped to 10 to force alpha.5.25/alpha.5.26 role decisions to rebuild under the calibrated evidence model.
- SearchEngine, ResultRanking, usage scoring, pinyin, Everything and Classic geometry/repaint behavior are unchanged.
- Added generic Contoso/Fabrikam/Acme regressions for weak-vs-strong evidence, related group context, multiple companion preservation, alternate launch entries and user-shortcut non-interference.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.197`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.26

- Activated the schema-9 launch-role evidence model in static application query admission.
- `CatalogVisibility::Normal` keeps existing behavior; `StrongMatchOnly` entries are suppressed on shared family/product-name queries and reappear only for distinctive entry intent, exact full-entry queries, or explicit wildcard/path syntax.
- `CatalogVisibility::Hidden` entries stay out of normal Launcher search even on exact/wildcard queries; filesystem search remains available through Everything.
- User-authored shortcuts remain authoritative and bypass generated catalog suppression.
- Distinctive intent uses the precomputed `distinctiveTokens` from alpha.5.25 only; no file, registry, Version Resource or catalog rebuild work was added to the keystroke hot path.
- Role-aware admission happens before existing LaunchSurface admission and before ranking. Relevance scoring, usage scoring, provider ordering and ResultRanking are unchanged.
- Added generic Contoso search regressions for primary/companion preservation, family-name suppression, explicit benchmark/settings access, hidden updater behavior and user-shortcut authority.
- No SolidWorks/Adobe/Autodesk/TeamSpeak or other product-specific search rule was added.
- Provider Cache remains schema 9; Classic geometry/assets and repaint behavior are unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.196`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.25

- Added the provider-neutral Launch Role Evidence Model with separate `ApplicationRole`, `RoleConfidence` and `CatalogVisibility` concepts instead of overloading search-surface classification.
- Added cached Windows executable Version Resource inspection for FileDescription, ProductName, CompanyName, OriginalFilename and InternalName. Metadata is read only during provider discovery, never in the query hot path.
- Added deterministic role evidence aggregation for primary/companion apps, user tools, configuration/diagnostic/benchmark tools, installer/maintenance roles and background/service/internal components.
- Added conservative catalog grouping from product + install-root/menu evidence and precomputed distinctive title tokens for future role-aware query intent.
- Provider commands now persist role, confidence, visibility, group key and distinctive tokens; generated Provider Cache schema is now 9 and older generated caches rebuild from live providers.
- Added generic Contoso/Fabrikam role-model regressions. No product-specific SolidWorks, TeamSpeak or other application blacklist/rule was introduced.
- Alpha.5.25 deliberately does not apply `CatalogVisibility` in SearchEngine/ResultRanking yet, preserving current search-result behavior while the evidence model is validated.
- Classic UI/geometry, canonical identity, provider dedupe, relevance ranking, usage scoring, pinyin, Everything and numeric Quick Launch are unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.195`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.24

- Added `WS_CLIPCHILDREN` to the launcher parent so Classic background/title paints cannot run underneath native EDIT/LISTBOX/preview children.
- Reworked Preview/Title updates into cached state: identical title/command text no longer sends redundant `WM_SETTEXT` or parent invalidations.
- Removed the no-result whole-window invalidation path; Classic title refresh now targets only the title band with `RDW_NOERASE | RDW_NOCHILDREN`.
- Live result rebuilds no longer toggle `WM_SETREDRAW` when row count is unchanged and skip LISTBOX repaint entirely when rendered rows/selection are unchanged.
- Result repaint is restricted to the actually changed row span, making repeated no-result typing and backspace a visual no-op.
- Classic geometry/assets, search/ranking, numeric Quick Launch, provider catalog behavior and Provider Cache schema 8 remain unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.194`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.23

- Removed per-keystroke `LB_RESETCONTENT` from the owner-drawn launcher result list.
- Result updates now preserve existing LISTBOX row slots and adjust only the row-count delta before repainting.
- Live result repaint no longer requests a background erase, avoiding the visible Classic flash during continuous typing.
- Query edits no longer deselect the old row before redraw is suspended; the new best result is selected atomically with the rebuilt snapshot.
- Kept Classic geometry/assets, ranking, numeric Quick Launch, provider catalog behavior and Provider Cache schema 8 unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.193`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.22

- Split Windows Apps enumeration into detailed discovery/admission and lightweight monitor fingerprint consumers.
- Provider Monitor no longer reads HIDDEN/SYSTEM or `PKEY_AppUserModel_PreventPinning` every 5 seconds; those Shell properties are queried only during actual discovery.
- ChangeToken now stores only compact per-item hashes while enumerating AppsFolder instead of building a temporary full ShellApp vector.
- Kept Intelligent Launch Catalog identity, packaged activation, positive admission, search/ranking and Provider Cache schema 8 unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.192`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.21

- Added provider-neutral `LaunchCatalog` ownership for activation semantics, canonical launch identity and packaged visibility evidence.
- Added `Command::activationKind` and `Command::canonicalIdentity`; Provider Cache schema is now 8 and requires canonical identity for generated commands.
- Start Menu identity resolves the `.lnk` target plus embedded arguments while preserving the `.lnk` as the actual execution target.
- App Paths/PATH generate executable identities; AppsFolder generates AUMID identities.
- CommandMerge now deduplicates provider entries by canonical identity before legacy display-name fallback, fixing Start Menu/App Paths duplicates such as Google Chrome without fuzzy-name guessing.
- AppsFolder AUMIDs launch through native `IApplicationActivationManager::ActivateApplication`; ShellExecute remains the path for Win32 shortcuts/files/URIs.
- Added structural internal-packaged admission using Shell HIDDEN or SYSTEM + PreventPinning evidence.
- Added generic ProductInfo admission role for action-like About/关于 entries instead of per-product blacklists.
- Replaced the TeamSpeak-specific merge fixture with generic promotion/identity tests and kept all temporary root-cause diagnostic code removed.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.191`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.20

- Removed `LaunchTargetKind::ExecutableUnknown` and the file-exists/GetBinaryType fallback added in alpha.5.17 after real-machine diagnostics proved TeamSpeak 6 is a normal GUI executable and alpha.5.16 admission already accepts it.
- Removed the temporary alpha.5.19 `--diagnose-shortcut` product entry point and detailed inspector scaffolding after collecting the required evidence.
- Restored strict alpha.5.16 executable target admission: unclassified `.exe` targets are not accepted merely because the file exists.
- Bumped generated Provider Cache schema to 7 so schema-6 candidates admitted only by the removed fallback cannot survive cleanup.
- Added explicit empty-provider-cache Building/non-searchable regression coverage, preserving alpha.5.18 atomic publication during the schema-7 rebuild.
- Historical review excludes Inspector/Admission, Merge and Search from the TeamSpeak failure path and identifies alpha.5.16's visible-before-refresh startup lifecycle as the remaining matching defect already fixed in alpha.5.18.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.190`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.19

- Added stage-preserving executable inspection diagnostics without changing launch admission behavior.
- Records the exact alpha.5.16 pre-fallback target kind separately from the current target kind.
- Records PE parsing stage, optional-header magic, subsystem, file existence, GetBinaryType fallback use and Shell Link resolution stage.
- Added temporary `--diagnose-shortcut <lnk>` developer probe writing `data/launch-target-diagnostic.json`; it does not rebuild providers or mutate settings.
- Added runtime regressions proving ordinary PE targets do not use the fallback while the intentionally opaque fixture does.
- Kept Provider Cache schema at 6 so diagnosis is not confounded by another forced provider rebuild.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.189`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.18

- Added explicit static-provider index states: Ready, Building and Degraded.
- Missing/stale/incomplete Provider Cache snapshots are no longer exposed as a temporary user-command-only launcher index while background discovery is still running.
- Launcher reveal is deferred while the provider index is Building; valid cached snapshots still show immediately and refresh off the startup path.
- Provider refresh now publishes one completed cache snapshot through CommandStore before refreshing/revealing the launcher.
- Added bounded provider admission diagnostics with evaluated/admitted/rejected counts, per-reason counts and rejected candidate samples containing discovered/resolved target, target kind, surface and reason.
- Start Menu records shortcut-resolution failures; App Paths records stale missing targets; all four static providers participate in detailed discovery diagnostics.
- Added provider-index policy tests and Windows provider smoke accounting checks.
- Provider Cache schema remains 6; Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.188`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.17

- Added `LaunchTargetKind::ExecutableUnknown` for existing `.exe` targets whose PE subsystem cannot be classified as GUI/CUI.
- Start Menu and App Paths positive admission now accept such real executables after existing documentation/maintenance/auxiliary filters, preventing legitimate apps such as user-local TeamSpeak installations from being falsely dropped.
- Added explicit `LaunchAdmissionReason` values so candidate admission has a deterministic reason instead of a bare boolean.
- Added TeamSpeak-style admission regression and Windows runtime `.lnk` coverage for an opaque existing `.exe` target.
- Kept the existing TeamSpeak 3 + TeamSpeak 6 merge regression unchanged, confirming canonicalization preserves both distinct applications.
- Bumped generated Provider Cache schema to 6 so schema-5 caches rebuild and rediscover previously omitted executable candidates.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.187`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.16

- Added a provider-neutral LaunchCandidate admission layer so discovery is positive-admission instead of default-accept followed by ranking cleanup.
- Start Menu `.lnk` files are resolved with native IShellLink/IPersistFile inspection for admission; document/help/manual/What's New/web/maintenance/auxiliary shortcuts are rejected while the original `.lnk` remains the execution target.
- AppsFolder now rejects web URI/vendor website entries and non-launch content before command creation.
- App Paths now inspects PE subsystem: GUI executables stay primary, console executables become CommandLineTool, and maintenance/helper/native-messaging entries are excluded.
- PATH remains opt-in and now shares candidate admission, preventing obvious helper/maintenance binaries from entering the CLI index.
- Added pure admission regressions for `访问 Java.com`, WinRAR `最新版本里有哪些新功能`, maintenance/helper entries, system tools and CLI tools.
- Added Windows runtime tests that create real `.lnk` files and verify native shortcut resolution plus GUI/console/document target inspection.
- Hardened release consistency: stable tags remain immutable, while an active same-VERSION prerelease is refreshed to the final green HEAD after in-version CI fixes so main/dev-latest/version tag cannot diverge.
- Bumped generated Provider Cache schema to 5 so pre-admission schema-4 candidates are rebuilt.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.186`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.15

- Added LaunchSurfaceClass to provider commands and split primary apps, system utilities, developer tools, command-line tools, auxiliary helpers and maintenance entries before search ranking.
- Added generic role-based application classification for Help/Helper/Host/Broker/NativeMessaging/ExperienceShell/BackgroundTask/Updater-style entries without per-product blacklists.
- Start Menu now emits surface metadata instead of relevance penalties; AppsFolder and App Paths use the same generic classifier; PATH entries are explicitly CommandLineTool.
- New installations default PATH Provider off. Existing explicit PATH settings are preserved, while legacy settings that predate a windows.path key keep the historical implicit enabled behavior.
- Extracted RelevancePolicy as the single owner for literal matching, short-query fuzzy gates, initials, path intent, surface admission and structured rank comparison.
- Everything no longer starts for ordinary one-character queries and no longer keeps a second permissive fuzzy scorer; explicit syntax/path queries retain fallback support.
- Replaced final additive ranking ownership with structured precedence: explicit user/pinned intent → match quality → launch surface → match field → literal/pinyin → match score → usage → kind/provider tie-breakers.
- Bumped generated Provider Cache schema to 4 so older unclassified provider entries are rebuilt.
- Added classifier, surface-admission, dynamic-result and provider-cache regression coverage including the one-character helper-noise scenario.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.185`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.14

- Added query-length-aware search admission: 1–2 character ASCII queries no longer use arbitrary subsequence fuzzy matching, 3-character fuzzy is gap/span bounded, and 4+ fuzzy matches must clear a real minimum score.
- Split match quality into explicit kinds so derived English/camel initials and pinyin initials are exact/prefix-only instead of recursively fuzzy.
- Removed execution targets from ordinary lexical search; target/path matching now requires path intent or explicit wildcard use.
- Made multi-token queries strict AND while preserving the anchored Hybrid Pinyin route used by cases such as `wei x`.
- Added Start Menu entry hygiene: `.url` plus documentation/help/website/release-note shortcuts are filtered; admin/developer/maintenance entries remain discoverable at lower entry-level priority without changing Provider canonicalization order.
- Bumped generated Provider Cache schema to 3 so stale pre-classification Start Menu entries are rebuilt.
- Added regressions for `cs`, `df`, short `cd`, tight-fuzzy `cde`, explicit target-path search, existing pinyin/initials behavior and Windows Start Menu output policy.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.184`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.13

- Added a pure/testable Classic numeric-input arbitration policy instead of treating every bare digit as an unconditional launch command.
- Classic Tab/Shift+Tab and Up/Down now wrap across the 1…9,0 result cycle; Modern Compact remains bounded.
- Bare digits stay text for empty queries, IME/Shift/Win input, recent typing bursts, unavailable result numbers and strong command/result prefix continuations.
- Strong continuation checks scan existing command/static/dynamic result caches only; no second full search or Everything query is issued.
- Ambiguous numeric launches use a 90ms pending intent; a following key converts the digit to text, otherwise the original numbered result snapshot executes.
- Ctrl+digit and Alt+digit provide an explicit immediate numbered-launch path.
- Consumed numeric keys suppress matching WM_CHAR/WM_SYSCHAR messages, fixing the v → v2 query flash during Quick Launch.
- Added focused ClassicBehavior unit coverage for wrap navigation, arbitration, v2ray/7zip/1password/cs2-style prefixes and timing constants.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.183`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.12

- Identified the remaining artifact source as the real multi-step `ListView_SetColumnWidth()` commit rather than resize-preview rendering.
- Added a shared RAII redraw transaction around runtime column commit.
- Pause redraw on both ListView and Header before changing dragged/elastic widths so no intermediate report-view layout is presented.
- Preserve the validated grow/shrink ordering while making all width updates one visual commit.
- Reenable redraw and synchronously repaint the entire ListView/Header tree with `RDW_INVALIDATE | RDW_ERASE | RDW_FRAME | RDW_ALLCHILDREN | RDW_UPDATENOW`.
- This full commit repaint clears stale owner-drawn group text, row pixels, empty-body pixels and copied custom-frame pixels before the next input event.
- Keep alpha.5.11 Header-only preview and alpha.5.9 single resize owner unchanged.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.182`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.11

- Removed the resize-guide HWND architecture entirely; no child, popup or layered preview window remains.
- Store only the clamped preview x-coordinate in `NextListState`.
- Paint the active two-logical-pixel resize preview directly inside `DrawHeaderSurface()` during the Header's normal `WM_PAINT`.
- Restrict resize feedback to the 34-logical-pixel Header so Path Conversion group text, normal rows and empty ListView body are never overlapped by drag feedback.
- Keep the alpha.5.9 unified capture/clamp/cancel/commit state machine and `HDS_NOSIZING` native-Header lockout unchanged.
- Remove popup composition, screen-coordinate guide movement, layered-window lifetime and ListView-size guide repositioning code.
- Add release-contract guards that reject any future resize-preview HWND architecture.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.181`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.10

- Kept the alpha.5.9 single-owner resize state machine and replaced only the guide rendering boundary.
- Removed the resize guide from the ListView child-window tree so moving the guide no longer changes ListView/Header clipping or expose behavior.
- Recreated the guide as a non-activating `WS_EX_LAYERED` owned popup with `WS_POPUP`, `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` and `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE`.
- Position the guide in screen coordinates from the current ListView rectangle; moving the guide is now an independent USER/DWM composition operation.
- Added `SWP_NOCOPYBITS` so the tiny guide surface is repainted rather than copying stale popup bits while it moves.
- Preserved alpha.5.9 divider hit testing, capture/cancel lifecycle, minimum-width clamp and one-shot elastic Target/Status commit.
- Added real-Windows validation for dragging through owner-drawn group text and over the empty ListView body with zero text fragments or vertical trails.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.180`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.9

- Replaced the mixed native Header + consumer HDN resize flow with one shared `UiListView` resize controller.
- Disabled native Header sizing with `HDS_NOSIZING` and removed `HDS_FULLDRAG`; divider mouse-down no longer enters the native tracking state machine.
- Moved hit testing, mouse capture, preview clamping, capture-loss cancellation and one-shot final commit into the shared Header subclass.
- Removed Shortcut Manager and Path Conversion `columnTracking_`, tracked-column state, `ClampTrackedColumnWidth` and `HandleHeaderNotification` resize paths.
- Added a shared logical-pixel resize policy for the first three resizable columns plus the elastic Target/Status column.
- Reparented the 2-logical-pixel preview guide to the ListView so guide geometry and lifetime belong to the same component.
- Preserved validated grow/shrink commit ordering to avoid transient horizontal overflow/bottom flash.
- Preserved alpha.5.6 Table visuals, alpha.5.7 hit zone/cursor, default/minimum widths and all frozen business behavior.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.179`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.8

- Replaced direct ListView/Header DC resize-guide painting with a dedicated shared overlay child window.
- Removed the old invalidate-strip/paint-again guide path that could leave multiple vertical trails and blue blocks during fast dragging.
- Move the 2-logical-pixel guide with `SetWindowPos` only; no full ListView repaint occurs for each drag motion.
- Enabled `HDS_FULLDRAG` to suppress the native legacy tracker while existing `HDN_ITEMCHANGING` guards continue blocking live column-width commits.
- Hide the overlay on normal release, capture loss and destruction; final column widths still commit only once at `HDN_ENDTRACK`.
- Preserved alpha.5.7 expanded divider hit zone, resize cursor, default widths, elastic Target/Status behavior and all Table visuals.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.178`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.7

- Expanded shared Header divider hit zones to ±4 logical pixels and added immediate `IDC_SIZEWE` feedback.
- Added a clearer hover-only divider hint and a two-pixel drag preview guide spanning the Header and table body.
- Disabled `HDS_FULLDRAG` in the shared ListView Header so drag motion no longer continuously resizes/reflows ListView columns.
- Wired Shortcut Manager HDN tracking into the shared preview guide while retaining its deferred elastic Target commit.
- Reworked Path Conversion column tracking to the same deferred begin/track/end model and commit its elastic Status column only once on release.
- Changed first-open Shortcut Manager columns to 110 / 180 / 110 logical pixels with Target elastic.
- Changed first-open Path Conversion columns to 110 / 360 / 380 logical pixels with Status elastic, preserving existing minimum widths on smaller windows.
- Preserved native Header capture, resize notifications, DPI behavior, saved runtime widths, row rendering, checkbox behavior and all business logic.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.177`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.6

- Replaced the visible native Header painting with a shared `UiListView` Header subclass while keeping native Header hit testing and resize notifications.
- Added a 34-logical-pixel Next Table Header with semibold text, card background, one soft bottom hairline and no permanent vertical column grid lines.
- Disabled the Header's themed visual surface so static table appearance no longer exposes classic `WC_HEADER` borders/buttons.
- Added subtle resize-boundary feedback only when the pointer is directly over a native Header divider.
- Increased shared list cell padding from 10 to 12 logical pixels and lightened row separators for a less spreadsheet-like body.
- Kept Shortcut Manager column constraints, elastic Target behavior, width state, keyboard/context actions and double-click editing unchanged.
- Kept Path Conversion grouped rows, high-DPI checkbox, conversion workflow and elastic Status behavior unchanged; lightened group-section background.
- Removed parent `NM_CUSTOMDRAW` Header routes from Shortcut Manager and Path Conversion because Header rendering now lives entirely in `UiListView`.
- Added release-contract coverage for the new Header subclass/table-surface architecture and update ordering alpha.5.5 -> alpha.5.6.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.176`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.5

- Added shared `UiListView` native Win32/GDI infrastructure for report-list framing, Header drawing, row metrics, hover state, selection colors, cell padding and row separators.
- Migrated Shortcut Manager to the shared ListView surface and removed its old hard `WS_BORDER` table edge.
- Reused the existing Shortcut Manager custom row text/ellipsis logic while moving Header and row visual tokens to the shared component.
- Preserved Shortcut Manager column dragging, minimum widths, elastic Target behavior, remembered custom widths, keyboard/context actions and double-click editing.
- Migrated Path Conversion Header and standard preview rows to the same shared list surface while retaining grouped shortcut rows and the high-DPI custom checkbox renderer.
- Removed body-column grid lines; dense rows now separate horizontally and use subtle hover / light-blue selection feedback.
- Kept native scrollbars and all conversion/business behavior unchanged.
- Added release-contract coverage for one shared ListView path and update ordering alpha.5.4 -> alpha.5.5.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.175`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.4

- Extracted the alpha.5.3 Settings ComboBox renderer into shared `UiComboBox` Win32/GDI infrastructure.
- Migrated all seven Settings dropdowns to the shared component without changing their approved alpha.5.3 visual treatment.
- Migrated Shortcut Editor Target type and Runtime input from native old-style ComboBoxes to the same Next-themed shared control.
- Centralized ComboBox closed-surface painting, dropdown item drawing, hover/focus interaction, 30-logical-pixel metrics and localized preferred-width measurement.
- Preserved the Shortcut Editor's compact aligned value-column bounds while removing its duplicate native text-width measurement code.
- Added release-contract coverage preventing Settings or Shortcut Editor from reintroducing direct `COMBOBOX` creation.
- Preserved schemaVersion 10 and all frozen Classic/provider/Everything/updater contracts.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.174`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.3

- Reworked the shared native Settings ComboBox surface into one continuous rounded control with a clearer chevron and lightweight hover/focus feedback.
- Added DPI-aware content measurement so all seven Settings ComboBoxes size from their localized items instead of fixed 160/180-logical-pixel widths.
- Normalized closed/list item metrics to 30 logical pixels across DPI changes while retaining owner-drawn Win32/GDI rendering.
- Fixed Hotkeys viewport clipping so scrolling can no longer resurrect business-hidden status/reset HWNDs.
- Collapsed hidden hotkey status controls to zero drawable geometry, removing the pale strip below the final row of a hotkey card.
- Added update-ordering and release-contract coverage for alpha.5.2 -> alpha.5.3 while preserving schemaVersion 10 and frozen Classic/provider/Everything/updater contracts.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.173`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.5.2

- Fixed Open Shortcut Manager so default Alt+S is a real global Windows hotkey and works while the Launcher is hidden.
- Added transactional RegisterHotKey lifecycle for Shortcut Manager: startup registration, live rebinding, rollback on conflict, reset-to-default support and clean unregistration.
- Added independent vertical scrolling to the Hotkeys page while keeping Reset all hotkeys fixed in the bottom action area.
- Unified all seven Settings ComboBoxes behind a native owner-drawn/subclassed Next-themed control path with consistent borders, text, selection rows and arrow surface.
- Simplified startup notification copy to “已在后台启动 / 按 <hotkey> 呼出” and normalized executable FileDescription to “ALTRun Next”.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 10 and all frozen Classic/provider/Everything/updater contracts.
- Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.172`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.5.1

- Rebuilt General Settings around Windows & startup, Search & execution, and Window placement; removed six implementation-detail settings from UI and schema.
- Added three-state Startup behavior with silent, native startup notification, and show-launcher modes; fresh installs default to notification while schema-9 migration preserves the previous show-on-startup intent.
- Added opt-in Windows SendTo integration backed by an ALTRun Next.lnk, --add-shortcut command-line mode, bounded single-instance WM_COPYDATA forwarding, and the existing confirmed New Shortcut editor.
- Made launcher session behavior intrinsic: reveal clears the query, successful execution hides, focus loss hides outside modal/context operations, wildcard syntax is always enabled, and numeric quick-launch numbering is fixed to 1–9,0.
- Added Open Shortcut Manager (Alt+S) and disabled-by-default Exit ALTRun Next actions to the centralized Hotkey Registry.
- Retained all four window-placement preferences and the optional system-tray icon.
- Migrated settings schemaVersion from 9 to 10 and stopped serializing showOnStartup, hideAfterLaunch, clearQueryOnShow, hideOnFocusLost, wildcardMatching, and numericQuickLaunchOrder.
- Kept Classic HiDPI assets and all non-Settings architecture frozen; Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is `0.8.0.171`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.4.9

- Preserved the original 25×25 Classic Logo/X resources byte-for-byte for the 100% tier and added deterministic 31/38/44/50px HiDPI tiers for 125/150/175/200%.
- Added `scripts/generate_classic_hidpi_assets.py`, a standard-library-only generator/verifier that converts the legacy black transparent key to premultiplied alpha and performs deterministic bilinear resampling.
- Replaced the single Logo/X bitmap handles with fixed five-tier arrays loaded once at startup; standard DPIs select an exact-size bitmap and unusual DPIs select the next larger tier before any downscale.
- Kept the 25px tier on the original `TransparentBlt` path and switched only generated HiDPI tiers to native `AlphaBlend` with `AC_SRC_ALPHA`, avoiding GDI+, Direct2D, WIC and runtime image decoding.
- Added the user-validated 175% / 168-DPI Classic geometry snapshot and explicit 25/31/38/44/50 glyph-tier selection coverage to `ui_foundation_tests`.
- Kept Classic background/typography/geometry and Modern/search/provider/Everything/updater behavior frozen; settings schemaVersion remains 9.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.79`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.4.8

- Added a single constexpr ClassicLauncherMetricsForDpi() contract for the frozen Classic client/control geometry, row height, divider positions, title/drag metrics, Logo/X sizing and rounded-region diameter.
- Cached one Classic DPI snapshot per monitor DPI and routed Launcher layout, ListBox item height, rounded region, title/drag geometry, Logo/X sizing and x=23/x=230 divider placement through it without adding work to the result-row paint hot path.
- Explicitly froze Classic separator thickness at **1 physical pixel** instead of DPI-scaling the line width.
- Expanded ui_foundation_tests with exact 96/120/144/192 DPI snapshots for 100%/125%/150%/200%, including control rectangles, title/close/glyph metrics and invariants for ten rows, the 6-logical-px skin band and Command containment.
- Added a focused alpha.4.8 real-Windows DPI checklist with expected physical rectangles and Per-Monitor V2 monitor-transition validation; removed obsolete Hint-strip wording from the historical Classic freeze checklist.
- Preserved the alpha.4.7 native BMP/GDI render path and COLORONCOLOR policy pending real 125%/150% visual evidence; Modern Compact and all search/provider/updater behavior remain frozen.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 9 and updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.78`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.4.7

- Kept Classic as a visual skin while continuing to modernize the runtime implementation for low overhead and maintainability.
- Added `src/resources/classic_bg.bmp`, a deterministic **444×357 / 24-bit** BMP materialized from the authorized original `classic_bg.jpg`; the runtime crop/appearance remains the same as alpha.4.6.
- Switched the Classic background resource from JPEG `RCDATA` to native Windows `BITMAP` and load it through `LoadImageW(..., LR_CREATEDIBSECTION)`.
- Removed the runtime JPEG/GDI+ decode path: `LoadClassicJpegResource`, resource-to-HGLOBAL copy, `IStream`, `CreateStreamOnHGlobal`, GDI+ startup/shutdown and the `gdiplus` linker dependency are gone.
- Kept `objbase.h` and `ole32` because the result-icon worker still uses COM independently of Classic skin loading.
- Cached the Classic background dimensions and one reusable memory DC at launcher creation; background, Logo and Close blits no longer allocate/delete their own compatible DC during each paint.
- Removed Classic per-row GDI allocation churn: system brushes paint white/highlight backgrounds directly, and the fixed x=23/x=230 separators use the stock `DC_BRUSH` with exact 1px `FillRect` rectangles instead of a freshly created HPEN per row.
- Left Modern Compact drawing behavior unchanged while preserving all alpha.4.6 Classic geometry, typography, command path ellipsis and fixed columns.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 9 and updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.77`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.4.6

- Kept Classic+ as an interpretation of ALTRun rather than a literal port: retain the useful visual identity while preferring simpler current Win32 code and lower maintenance cost.
- Removed the Classic Hint implementation completely. Deleted the Hint HWND, creation path, font/frame/theme handling, layout/update code, WM_DRAWITEM branch, control ID 1004 path and `TextId::ClassicHint` localization entry instead of leaving hidden dead code.
- Corrected the Classic ListBox geometry from **404×160 to 404×164** at y=56. Ten 16px rows remain unchanged; the four extra client pixels restore the intended six-pixel skin band above the command bar.
- Replaced the Classic read-only command Edit with an owner-drawn STATIC at **8,226 / 404×16**.
- Rendered the command line with the existing auxiliary font and one native `DrawTextW` call using `DT_PATH_ELLIPSIS`, preserving the path beginning and final component while compacting the middle.
- Added no new runtime library or shell helper dependency for command compaction; the implementation remains GDI/Win32-only and lightweight.
- Preserved alpha.4.5 fixed x=23/x=230 result columns, full-opacity Classic colors, original authorized skin/glyph assets, Modern Compact, providers/Everything, updater and shared presentation architecture.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 9 and updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.76`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.4.5

- Started the Classic+ phase: retain original ALTRun visual identity where it is beneficial, but remove legacy rendering behavior that reduces readability or breaks with modern result data.
- Raised Classic layered alpha from **240 to 255** while retaining the black color key, original BG.jpg, borderless 420×250 client and 12-logical-pixel round region. Classic colors now render at full fidelity instead of being globally washed out.
- Replaced the clipped 14px raw Win32 Hint Edit with an owner-drawn Classic Hint overlay. It uses the original -13 SimSun font, right alignment, vertical centering and ellipsis.
- Added query-aware Hint avoidance: measure the actual input text width, move the Hint right with an 8-logical-pixel gap, and hide it when less than 104 logical pixels remain.
- Replaced the original `%-25s| %s` row-string emulation with fixed Classic columns at logical x=23 and x=230. Long shortcut/name text is clipped per column with `DT_END_ELLIPSIS`, so Chinese, English and mixed-width text cannot move the separators.
- Unified Classic icon-off and icon-on row geometry around the same fixed columns. Optional result icons consume space only inside the shortcut column.
- Rendered Classic separators as real one-physical-pixel GDI lines: Navy normally and system highlight-text color on the selected row.
- Preserved the original authorized BG/Logo/Close assets, -16/-13 SimSun metrics, 16px×10-row density, Modern Compact, providers/Everything, context actions, updater and shared window-presentation architecture.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 9 and updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.75`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.4.4

- Switched Classic refinement to a source-parity foundation based directly on the authorized original ALTRun DFM/source instead of screenshot-driven procedural approximations.
- Embedded the exact original 74,289-byte `BG.jpg` from `imgBackground.Picture.Data` and replaced the hand-built Classic title gradient/rails/frame with the real background skin.
- Restored the original borderless **420×250** Classic client, **240/255** layered alpha, black color key and **12 px logical** round region while retaining ALTRun Next Per-Monitor V2 positioning and first-reveal presentation.
- Restored DFM control geometry: input 8,30/404×22; Hint 82,35/328×14; list 8,56/404×160; command line 8,226/404×16.
- Replaced the Classic Hint STATIC with a disabled read-only right-aligned Edit and added a dedicated read-only Classic command Edit; Modern keeps its existing preview control.
- Changed Classic font creation from point-size approximation to exact original LOGFONT heights **-16/-13 @ 96 DPI**, SimSun, ANSI_CHARSET, normal weight and DEFAULT_QUALITY.
- Restored original Classic colors: clYellow title, clRed input, clNavy list text, clGray command text, clWindow list background and clMoneyGreen Edit surfaces.
- With result icons off, Classic now renders one fixed-format row string matching the original ` %d|%-25s| %s` layout using one `ExtTextOutW` GDI text run and Windows system selection colors. The optional icon-enabled layout remains an ALTRun Next enhancement.
- Preserved Modern Compact, search/ranking/providers/Everything, context actions, alpha.3.40 rapid-click behavior, alpha.3.36 updater hardening and shared top-level presentation.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 9 and updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.74`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.4.3

- Replaced the procedural GDI recreations of the Classic top-left shortcut glyph and top-right close glyph with the original ALTRun fixed-pixel bitmap resources, used with permission from the original author.
- Extracted the exact original `btnShortCut` 25×25 32-bit BMP and `btnClose` 25×25 24-bit BMP from `Form/frmALTRun.dfm`, embedded them through `resources.rc`, and render them with black-key transparency.
- Restored original Classic corner geometry: shortcut glyph at logical (8,2); close hit/control rectangle 22×22 at logical top 4/right inset 6, with the 25×25 glyph centered and clipped like the original TSpeedButton.
- Increased Classic Hint/Preview auxiliary typography from **10 pt to 11 pt** based on alpha.4.2 real-Windows comparison. Primary input/result/title typography remains 12 pt.
- Added `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` provenance for the two authorized original glyph assets and updated the project description so the clean-room wording no longer overstates the visual-asset boundary.
- Preserved Classic 420 width / 16-row / 10-result density, Modern Compact, search/ranking/providers/Everything, result-icon pipeline, alpha.3.40 rapid-click normalization and alpha.3.36 updater hardening.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 9 and updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.73`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.4.2

- Matched Classic's primary typography to the original ALTRun source: search input, result list and launcher title now use **12 pt** Classic typography while Hint/Preview use a separate **10 pt** auxiliary font.
- Restored the Classic launcher title to normal weight; Modern Compact keeps its existing 10 pt title/body behavior.
- Added a dedicated launcher auxiliary font handle so Hint/Preview no longer inherit the primary result/input size.
- Stopped forcing `CLEARTYPE_QUALITY` for Classic fonts and use `DEFAULT_QUALITY`; application/settings and Modern Compact continue to use ClearType.
- Restored the Classic native search Edit to the full **22 logical px** input-strip height and removed the alpha.4.1 18 px centering compensation.
- Preserved 420 logical width, 16 logical result rows, 10-result density, result columns, search/ranking/providers/icons, alpha.3.40 rapid-click normalization and alpha.3.36 updater hardening.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 9 and updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.72`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.4.1

- Started Launcher refinement with Classic ALTRun rather than Modern Compact.
- Increased Classic launcher body typography from 9 pt to **10 pt**, keeping SimSun/Tahoma, ClearType, 420 logical width, 16 logical result rows and 10-result density unchanged.
- Kept the Classic green input strip at 22 logical px but reduced the native single-line Edit to **18 logical px** and centered it vertically inside the strip.
- Added explicit parent painting for the full Classic input strip so the centered Edit remains visually seamless with the existing right-side hint surface.
- Hardened Windows fixed-version mapping for the alpha.4 boundary: historical alpha.3 values stay unchanged, alpha.4.1 maps to 0.8.0.71, and future phase ranges remain monotonic in both metadata and package verification.
- Preserved Modern Compact typography/geometry, search/ranking/provider behavior, async result icons, context actions, alpha.3.40 rapid-click normalization and alpha.3.36 updater hardening.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 9 and updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.71`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.40

- Fixed rapid repeated Path Conversion checkbox clicks losing every second activation when Windows emitted `NM_DBLCLK` instead of `NM_CLICK`.
- Routed both `NM_CLICK` and `NM_DBLCLK` through the same first-column hit test and `ToggleResultRowSelection()`, preserving one toggle per physical click.
- Fixed rapid Advanced expand/collapse clicks in Shortcut Editor by accepting both `BN_CLICKED` and `BN_DOUBLECLICKED`, matching the already validated Settings toggle policy.
- Deliberately kept Browse/Test/Save/Cancel and Path Conversion Rescan/Apply as single-shot `BN_CLICKED` actions so double-clicks cannot execute operations twice.
- Preserved alpha.3.39 hit-area/focus fixes, alpha.3.38 owned checkbox rendering/state, alpha.3.34 selector rendering and alpha.3.36 updater hardening.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 9 and updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.70`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.39

- Hardened Path Conversion checkbox interaction after alpha.3.38 real-Windows testing showed the custom visual was correct but the exact-box hit target was too unforgiving.
- Added `GetResultFieldInteractionRect()` based on the real first Header column and row bounds; the whole Field cell now toggles `Row::selected`, while the checkbox visual/layout remains unchanged.
- Fixed Shortcut Editor Advanced clicks being intermittently lost after ComboBox use: `WM_PARENTNOTIFY` no longer steals focus during interactive child-control mouse-down.
- ComboBox focus is still dismissed by true parent-surface clicks and passive STATIC labels/hints, preserving the previously requested click-away behavior without interrupting Buttons/Edits/ComboBoxes.
- Preserved the alpha.3.38 owned checkbox model/raster, alpha.3.34 selector, 13/36/39/remainder Path Conversion columns, Shortcut Editor layout and alpha.3.36 updater hardening.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 9 and updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.69`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.38

- Removed the failed alpha.3.37 hybrid checkbox layer after real-Windows validation showed a black ListView state-image square.
- Deleted `LVS_EX_CHECKBOXES`, `LVSIL_STATE`, transparent state images, `LVIS_STATEIMAGEMASK`, `ListView_GetCheckState` and `ListView_SetCheckState` from Path Conversion.
- Added `Row::selected` as the single authoritative checkbox state. Existing paths still start selected; missing paths still start unselected.
- First-column native item text is now empty. ALTRun Next post-paints both the custom checkbox and **Target / Working directory / Custom icon** label from one real-row-center layout.
- Added exact custom checkbox hit-testing for mouse clicks and focused-row Space-key toggling; selected count and Apply now read directly from row state.
- Retained the DPI-bucketed 15/17/19/21/23 px, rounded 4×4 supersampled checkbox raster and the already validated alpha.3.34 mode selector.
- Preserved Path Conversion geometry/columns/semantics, settings schemaVersion 9 and alpha.3.36 updater dispatch hardening.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.68`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.37

- Replaced the visually inconsistent legacy ListView checkbox artwork in Path Conversion with a modern ALTRun Next checkbox while keeping native ListView checkbox state and interaction semantics.
- Installed transparent `LVSIL_STATE` images behind `LVS_EX_CHECKBOXES`; click hit-testing, Space toggling, `LVIS_STATEIMAGEMASK`, `ListView_GetCheckState` and `LVN_ITEMCHANGED` remain native.
- Added DPI-bucketed 15/17/19/21/23 px checkbox templates matching the validated mode-selector scale.
- Added 4×4 supersampled rounded-rectangle and checkmark coverage rendering directly to final device pixels.
- Centers each checkbox from the actual ListView row rectangle and positions it relative to the actual label rectangle; no fixed vertical nudge or fake row-height image list is used.
- Preserved alpha.3.34 selector rendering, alpha.3.35 no-leading-space row labels, alpha.3.36 updater dispatch hardening, settings schemaVersion 9 and all Path Conversion behavior/column rules.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.67`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.36

- Systemically fixed the updater UI state getting stuck on **Checking for updates...** while the background App state had already completed.
- Replaced updater progress/completion's primary `PostThreadMessageW` delivery with an App-lifetime `HWND_MESSAGE` dispatcher and window-targeted `PostMessageW`.
- Moved the 250 ms active-update reconciliation watchdog from a `SetTimer(nullptr, ...)` thread timer to the same message-only HWND, eliminating the shared nested-message-loop loss mode.
- Added an About-page HWND timer that exists only while an update worker/status is active; it independently re-reads App state, refreshes the owner-drawn status/action controls, and stops on terminal state, page leave, or Settings destruction.
- Preserved the 60-second absolute check watchdog, WinHTTP 5/5/15/15-second operation bounds, stop-token request cancellation, generation guards, synchronous status redraw and safe download/hash/staging/install flow.
- Preserved alpha.3.35 Path Conversion native checkbox/text alignment and the alpha.3.34 coverage selector unchanged.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 9; updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.66`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.35

- Fixed the Path Conversion result-row checkbox/text misalignment reported in real-Windows alpha.3.34 validation.
- Removed the synthetic small-image-list row-height shim that forced a 24 logical-pixel report row. Explorer ListView now owns row height from the active font and native checkbox state-image metrics, keeping checkbox and text vertically centered together across DPI scales.
- Removed the four leading spaces previously embedded in Target / Working directory / Custom icon labels; the native checkbox state-image slot now supplies the only first-column inset.
- Kept the alpha.3.34 DPI-bucketed 4×4 coverage mode selector unchanged after it passed real-Windows clarity validation.
- Preserved window geometry, 13/36/39/remainder columns, Header styling, flat actions, conversion semantics, settings schemaVersion 9, shared first-frame presentation and updater hardening.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.65`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.34

- Reworked the Path Conversion mode selector again after alpha.3.33 real-Windows validation still showed a soft/unclear ring and center dot.
- Removed the previous hard-edged integer disk/ring raster. The selector now uses discrete DPI buckets with hand-tuned physical-pixel diameters and a **4×4 subpixel coverage raster** written directly into the final device HDC.
- The selector is never rendered as a Windows theme glyph and is never bitmap-scaled. Ring and center-dot coverage are blended against the actual card fill color per destination pixel, preserving a clean 1:1 final raster at 100/125/150/175/200% class DPI ranges.
- DPI buckets currently resolve to 15/17/19/21/23 physical pixels with progressively tuned ring widths and 5/6/7/8/9 pixel center-dot targets.
- Focused or selected cards use the accent ring; disabled cards use subdued separator/muted colors. Card border, header, row density, buttons and all alpha.3.31 conversion behavior remain unchanged.
- Preserved the 960×560 default / 820×480 minimum geometry, settings schemaVersion 9, shared first-frame presentation and updater hardening.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.64`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.33

- Closed the remaining Path Conversion visual issues reported from real-Windows alpha.3.32 testing.
- Replaced the Windows-themed radio glyph with an ALTRun Next-owned integer-raster selector. The outer ring, inner cutout and selected center dot are filled directly on final device pixels, with odd pixel diameters and DPI-aware dimensions. This avoids both the soft GDI ellipse from alpha.3.31 and the chunky themed radio seen in alpha.3.32.
- Reduced the selected/focused mode-card border to a consistent **1 physical pixel** while keeping the existing selection background and accent color.
- Softened the custom result Header further with a lighter background, lighter separators and shorter vertical dividers; column widths and drag constraints are unchanged.
- Increased report-row breathing room slightly using a dedicated **24 logical-pixel** small-image-list row baseline, improving separation between shortcut group headers and their field rows without changing text size.
- Kept the alpha.3.32 flat Rescan/Apply buttons, Explorer ListView theme, empty-state position and all alpha.3.31 conversion interactions unchanged.
- Preserved the 960×560 default / 820×480 minimum window geometry, settings schemaVersion 9, shared first-frame presentation and updater hardening.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.63`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.32

- Polished Path Conversion after real-Windows alpha.3.31 review without changing conversion semantics or column behavior.
- Replaced the hand-drawn nested GDI radio circles in the **便携化 / 展开** cards with the Windows themed `BP_RADIOBUTTON` renderer. Checked/unchecked/hot/pressed/disabled states now snap to the native DPI pixel grid, removing the visibly soft selected dot.
- Converted **重新扫描** and **应用所选** to the same flat owner-drawn button language used elsewhere in ALTRun Next. Rescan remains secondary; Apply uses the accent fill when enabled and a quiet neutral disabled state.
- Removed the old `WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE` sunken ListView frame and applied Explorer common-control theming for cleaner rows/checkboxes.
- Added a flat custom-drawn ListView header using the application card/separator palette while keeping all alpha.3.31 column-resize constraints and the elastic Status column unchanged.
- Shifted the empty-state message slightly upward to 44% of the result region height so it reads as content rather than a mathematically centered placeholder.
- Preserved the 960×560 default / 820×480 minimum geometry, mode-card layout, live selection count, non-blocking apply success feedback, Escape/X close behavior and alpha.3.30 first-frame presentation policy.
- Preserved settings schemaVersion 9 and all updater hardening.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.62`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.31

- Redesigned the Path Conversion window around a compact tool-workflow instead of the previous oversized table/dialog layout.
- Reduced the default window from 1100×650 to **960×560 logical pixels** and added an **820×480 logical** minimum while keeping manual resizing available for the current session.
- Replaced the two stretched native radio rows with two full-width owner-drawn mode cards: **便携化** and **展开**, each with a semibold title, subdued direction hint, whole-card click target, Tab/Space activation and Left/Right keyboard switching.
- Moved the fixed conversion rule into a dedicated muted helper line under the mode cards and kept **重新扫描** as a secondary action.
- Renamed the third result column from **转换后** to **转换后路径** and replaced the fixed 155/350/350/130 widths with responsive Field/Current/Converted/Status balancing. The first three columns remain user-draggable while Status stays elastic and protected from direct resize.
- Removed ListView gridlines and lightened shortcut group headers to match the rest of the application surface.
- Added a real empty state inside the result list with mode-specific guidance when no paths need conversion.
- Added live bottom status text: shortcut count, convertible-field count and selected-field count. **应用所选** now disables when nothing is checked and updates immediately when checkboxes change.
- Removed the redundant bottom-right **关闭** button. The window closes through the title-bar X, Alt+F4 or Escape.
- Removed the success MessageBox after applying conversions. Successful writes now rescan immediately and show non-blocking **已应用 N 个路径转换** feedback in the status line; write failures still use the existing error dialog.
- Preserved conversion scope and semantics: Target, Working Directory and custom icons are eligible; arguments, URLs, UNC paths and bare commands remain unchanged, and missing paths remain unchecked by default.
- Preserved the alpha.3.30 shared top-level first-frame presentation policy and settings schemaVersion 9.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.61`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.30

- Audited every ALTRun Next-owned user-visible top-level window instead of patching the newly reported Shortcut Editor flash in isolation.
- Added a shared `TopLevelWindowPresentation` policy for top-level HWND creation/presentation: monitor-DPI probing, owner/work-area centering, DWM transition suppression, cloaked fully-painted first reveal and cloak-before-destroy teardown.
- Migrated **Launcher, Settings, Shortcut Manager, Shortcut Editor and Path Conversion** to the shared presentation barrier. The two previously hardened windows no longer keep private DWM implementations that can drift from the rest of the app.
- Removed legacy `CW_USEDEFAULT` birth rectangles from the real Launcher, Shortcut Editor and Path Conversion HWNDs. Those were the remaining app-owned windows that could cache an upper-left/default USER32 rectangle before being moved.
- Shortcut Editor now creates at an owner/monitor-resolved safe rectangle, resolves its content-dependent final height while hidden, re-centers the final rectangle, and only then reveals a fully painted cloaked frame.
- Path Conversion now follows the same owned-popup lifecycle with its final 1100×650 logical geometry resolved before the real HWND is created.
- Launcher now receives a safe explicit birth rectangle and uses the shared cloak/paint/flush barrier for its first reveal only; subsequent hotkey shows keep the existing lightweight fast path.
- Settings and Shortcut Manager retain their specialized placement semantics but now use the same shared Configure/Reveal/Hide presentation primitives as the modal windows.
- Native Windows-owned UI such as MessageBox and IFileOpenDialog remains system-managed; the audit specifically eliminates divergent lifecycle code from all custom top-level ALTRun Next windows.
- Preserved settings schemaVersion 9, Shortcut Manager size/column rules, Shortcut Editor layout/behavior and updater hardening.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.60`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.29

- Fixed Settings **靠近屏幕顶部** placement not taking effect after real-Windows validation of alpha.3.28.
- Root cause: Settings creation geometry already understood `top`, but the later hidden `PositionForShow()` pass still hard-coded every non-`last` mode to center and overwrote the correct pre-creation top rectangle immediately before reveal.
- Added a shared, unit-tested `settings_layout::ResolveWindowOrigin()` path for near-top/center geometry and routed both Settings creation and Settings show-time placement through it, preventing the two placement paths from drifting again.
- Systemically hardened Shortcut Manager first-frame presentation for tray launches. The real Manager HWND is no longer born at `CW_USEDEFAULT` and moved later; target monitor, target DPI, default 720×480 logical size and final top/center/last rectangle are resolved before `CreateWindowExW`.
- Added the same DWM first-frame barrier already proven by Settings: show/hide transitions are disabled, first reveal is cloaked until the final frame is painted/flushed, and close cloaks before hide/destroy. This prevents a cached/default upper-left birth rectangle from leaking into one compositor frame.
- Shortcut Manager creation and later show-time repositioning now share `ResolveShortcutManagerRect()`, which in turn uses the same `ResolveWindowOrigin()` and `ClampRectToWorkArea()` primitives as Settings.
- Added core placement-math coverage for center, near-top and work-area-constrained cases so future UI refactors cannot silently turn `top` back into center.
- Preserved schemaVersion 9, Manager reset-to-default sizing, Manager column closeout, Shortcut Editor closeout and updater hardening.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.59`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.28

- Unified the General -> Window placement vocabulary and behavior across Launcher, Settings and Shortcut Manager.
- Renamed the Chinese labels to **启动器显示器 / 启动器窗口位置 / 设置窗口位置 / 快捷项管理窗口位置** and standardized all position choices to **靠近屏幕顶部 / 屏幕居中 / 上次位置**.
- Added the missing **靠近屏幕顶部** mode to Settings and added all three placement modes to Shortcut Manager.
- Shortcut Manager no longer preserves its previous window size. Every newly opened Manager starts at the 720×480 logical default, while manual resizing remains available for the current open instance.
- Shortcut Manager **上次位置** persists only X/Y coordinates through SettingsStore; size/maximized state are deliberately excluded. Top/center placement uses the monitor containing the mouse; last-position placement uses the monitor nearest the saved coordinates and clamps the default-size window into the work area.
- Removed Shortcut Manager's local `WINDOWPLACEMENT` cache entirely and added `shortcutManagerMode/LastValid/LastX/LastY` to the persisted `windowPlacement` object.
- Settings window top placement uses the same near-top vertical rule as Launcher while preserving its existing center/last monitor-selection and work-area clamping behavior.
- Expanded the General Window placement card from three to four rows and kept ComboBox focus-dismiss behavior consistent for the new control.
- Upgraded settings.json from schemaVersion 8 to **schemaVersion 9**. Schema-8 files migrate atomically, preserve existing Launcher/Settings placement, and receive `shortcutManagerMode: "center"` with no valid last position.
- Preserved Shortcut Manager's validated 16/24/14/46 columns and 107/161/94/180 logical minimums, alpha.3.26 Editor interaction fixes and alpha.3.23 update hardening.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.58`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.27

- Corrected Shortcut Manager column lifecycle after real-Windows validation of alpha.3.26.
- Freshly opened Shortcut Manager windows still start from the validated 16/24/14/46 Keywords/Name/Type/Target balance.
- Manual column dragging is now intentionally local to the currently open Manager window. Closing and reopening the Manager resets the table to the validated default proportions instead of persisting arbitrary temporary drag widths.
- Removed the saved first-three-column width cache and its recreate-time restore path. Window placement remains preserved exactly as before.
- Raised the drag minimums for Keywords/Name/Type from 88/128/88 to 107/161/94 logical pixels, matching the accepted first-open widths at the 720×480 minimum Manager geometry. Users can still widen those columns while Target remains elastic, but cannot compress them below the validated baseline.
- Kept Target's 180 logical-pixel minimum, constrained guide-only Header dragging, elastic Target resizing and no-horizontal-scrollbar behavior.
- Preserved alpha.3.26 Advanced disclosure reliability, content-fit administrator checkbox hit area and width-only Header change detection.
- Preserved alpha.3.24 Editor geometry and alpha.3.23 update-check hardening.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8 and commands schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.57`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.26

- Removed the alpha.3.25 mouse-origin focus bookkeeping from Shortcut Editor Advanced after real-Windows testing showed it could make repeated disclosure clicks feel unreliable.
- Advanced remains a native owner-drawn Button for click/Tab/Space semantics, but its custom renderer no longer draws ODS_FOCUS at all, eliminating the persistent classic dotted focus rectangle without moving focus during BN_CLICKED.
- Reduced the **Run as administrator** checkbox HWND to its ideal content width using `BCM_GETIDEALSIZE` with a font/DPI-aware fallback. Clicking blank space to the right of the label therefore no longer toggles the checkbox.
- Fixed the root cause behind the unexpected Shortcut Manager column proportions: `HDN_ITEMCHANGED` from `ApplyLanguage()` text updates was incorrectly treated as a user width change, setting `customColumnWidths_` before first layout and silently bypassing the intended 16/24/14/46 defaults.
- Header notifications now enter custom-width mode only when `HDI_WIDTH` actually changed. Text-only label updates no longer alter column sizing state.
- Kept the validated 16/24/14/46 default Manager column balance and 88/128/88/180 logical minimum widths; with the false custom-width transition removed, fresh windows now actually receive that layout.
- Preserved constrained Header dragging, elastic Target behavior, column-session persistence, alpha.3.24 Editor geometry, Runtime Input, IME, modern pickers and path conversion.
- Preserved alpha.3.23 update-check cancellation, CheckTimedOut handling and 60-second watchdog.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8 and commands schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.56`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.25

- Closed the remaining Shortcut Editor Advanced-focus regression: mouse clicks now expand/collapse Advanced and immediately return focus to the dialog surface, so the classic dotted Button focus rectangle does not remain after pointer activation.
- Preserved keyboard accessibility: Tab focus and Space activation keep native Button focus/focus-cue behavior, while mouse and keyboard activation paths are tracked separately.
- Rebalanced Shortcut Manager's default four-column layout from the previous 22/26/12/40 split to 16/24/14/46 for Keywords/Name/Type/Target, giving Name and Type practical room without letting Target dominate wide windows.
- Raised responsive minimum widths to 88/128/88 logical pixels for Keywords/Name/Type and 180 logical pixels for Target so column dragging and narrow-window behavior stay readable.
- Aligned the hidden creation-time ListView widths with the new 720-pixel baseline while preserving the existing elastic Target-column model and guide-only Header dragging.
- Preserved user-dragged column widths for the current app session; only fresh/default layout uses the new balance.
- Preserved alpha.3.24 Shortcut Editor geometry, Runtime Input, Advanced field inset, native Edit/ComboBox behavior, IME, modern pickers, path conversion and all shortcut execution semantics.
- Preserved alpha.3.23 update-check cancellation, CheckTimedOut handling and 60-second watchdog.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8 and commands schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.55`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.24

- Reduced Shortcut Editor width from 620 to 590 logical pixels after the latest real-Windows density review.
- Kept the 36:64 Name/Keywords split while reducing the Name minimum from 200 to 190 logical pixels so the top row stays balanced in the narrower dialog.
- Shifted inline Target type / Runtime input / Advanced label-value rows 8 logical pixels left by tightening the localized label column from 84/116 to 76/108 logical pixels.
- Kept localized content-measured ComboBox sizing but increased breathing room around the selected text: the shared width now clamps to 158–185 logical pixels and includes 8 additional logical pixels of text/chrome padding.
- Removed the Advanced header's accent underline and accent pressed surface. Mouse clicks now leave the header neutral, while Windows keyboard-only focus cues remain available when focus cues are enabled.
- Added an 18 logical pixels right inset to Advanced text fields, picker buttons and the administrator option so expanded Advanced content no longer stretches to the same edge as primary Target content.
- Preserved alpha.3.23 vertical rhythm, native Edit font-metric height, 28-pixel rows, Runtime Input/Test Input expansion, IME, modern pickers, path conversion and adaptive footer height.
- Preserved alpha.3.23 update-check cancellation, CheckTimedOut handling and 60-second watchdog without changing updater endpoints or install semantics.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8, commands schemaVersion 2 and Shortcut Manager 720×480 default/minimum geometry.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.54`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.23

- Reduced Shortcut Editor width from 680 to 620 logical pixels for the final compact horizontal-density pass.
- Changed Name/Keywords from 38:62 with a 220-pixel Name minimum to 36:64 with a 200-pixel minimum.
- Replaced the fixed 190-pixel Target type / Runtime input ComboBox width with localized content measurement using the active UI font, native drop-arrow width and a 150–175 logical-pixel clamp; both rows still share one aligned width.
- Tightened only the Editor's top/section spacing by 8 logical pixels overall while preserving native Edit font-metric height, 28-pixel control rows, IME, Runtime Input, Advanced expansion, modern pickers and adaptive footer behavior.
- Audited the recurring About-page **正在检查更新... / Checking for updates...** stall beyond the earlier notification/repaint fixes: a synchronous WinHTTP worker could still remain the authoritative Checking state when the network operation itself stopped progressing.
- Made WinHTTP request handles cancellation-safe, validate timeout/redirect option setup, and replace `WinHttpQueryDataAvailable` body loops with fixed-size interruptible `WinHttpReadData` reads.
- Added explicit CheckTimedOut handling plus a 60-second App watchdog that invalidates the old update generation before requesting cancellation, so late worker results cannot overwrite the timeout state.
- Fixed the Ready-to-Install handoff flag to be read/consumed under the update mutex, removing a UI/worker data race found during the updater audit.
- Preserved the 250 ms reconciliation watchdog and synchronous owner-draw repaint as delivery/presentation defenses rather than relying on them as network timeouts.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8, commands schemaVersion 2, Shortcut Manager 720×480 default/minimum geometry and all frozen shortcut execution semantics.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.53`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.22

- Changed Shortcut Manager's fresh-session default size from 900x560 to 720x480 logical pixels, matching the already-validated minimum resize geometry.
- Centralized Shortcut Manager default/minimum width and height constants so creation, DPI scaling and `WM_GETMINMAXINFO` cannot drift independently.
- Preserved captured Shortcut Manager window placement: user-resized/repositioned sessions still reopen at their saved in-process placement rather than being reset to 720x480.
- Unified Shortcut Editor Target type and Runtime input ComboBox widths at 190 logical pixels so the controls and their explanatory hint columns align.
- Reused the Settings ComboBox focus-dismissal behavior in Shortcut Editor: clicks on dialog background, child controls or non-client chrome dismiss lingering Target type/Runtime input focus before normal click handling continues.
- Kept native ComboBox keyboard navigation and selection behavior intact; no custom replacement controls were introduced.
- Reduced Advanced focus styling from accent text + underline to neutral text + short accent underline while retaining native Button keyboard semantics.
- Tightened Shortcut Editor footer rhythm to 16 logical pixels content gap, 10 separator gap and 16 bottom margin, keeping the 32-pixel footer buttons and adaptive-height algorithm.
- Preserved Runtime Input, Test Input, modern file/folder/icon pickers, path conversion, shortcut execution, column dragging and all schemas.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8 and commands schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.52`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.21

- Performed the final real-Windows visual-density pass for Shortcut Editor across collapsed, Advanced-expanded and Runtime Input + Advanced states.
- Reduced Shortcut Editor width from 720 to 680 logical pixels so Advanced fields no longer create excessive horizontal dead space.
- Changed the top Name/Keywords split from 42/58 to 38/62, giving aliases/keywords more practical room while keeping Name compact.
- Fixed the empty-target Auto detect presentation: a brand-new shortcut now shows **等待输入目标 / Waiting for target** instead of incorrectly exposing the model's internal Application fallback as **识别为：应用程序 / Detected: Application**.
- Kept `InferShortcutCommandType("") == Application` unchanged internally so command collection, title suggestion, Runtime Input and compatibility behavior are not broadened by a UI-only state fix.
- Replaced the Advanced header's classic dotted Win32 focus rectangle with an accent text + short underline focus affordance while retaining native Button focus, Tab, Space and click semantics.
- Added a small visual gap before **Run as administrator** so the checkbox is separated from the Icon field without changing Advanced field ordering.
- Preserved native Edit/ComboBox controls, IME, modern file/folder/icon pickers, Runtime Input/Test Input behavior, adaptive dialog height, footer layout and Enter-to-save behavior.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8 and commands schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.51`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.20

- Escalated the remaining rare Settings upper-left flash from USER32 placement handling to DWM presentation handling after alpha.3.19 removed all real monitor-origin Settings birth rectangles.
- Added `DWMWA_TRANSITIONS_FORCEDISABLED` for the Settings top-level HWND so DWM does not animate show/hide from a cached/default representation.
- Added an explicit `DWMWA_CLOAK` first-frame barrier: position while hidden, cloak, `SW_SHOW`, synchronously redraw client/non-client/children, `DwmFlush()`, uncloak, then flush once more.
- The first DWM frame that can reach the user is therefore the complete Settings frame at the final Center/Last rectangle.
- Mirrored the barrier during close: capture current RECT, cloak + `DwmFlush()`, then `SWP_HIDEWINDOW`, persist position and destroy the hidden HWND.
- Kept cloak acquisition explicit to Show/Close rather than permanently cloaking from Create, avoiding a failure mode where an unsuccessful uncloak could leave Settings invisible.
- Reused the existing `dwmapi` link; no new runtime dependency was added.
- Preserved alpha.3.19 birth-rect/DPI behavior, alpha.3.18 `SW_SHOW` semantics, alpha.3.16 update-status repaint reliability and all frozen shortcut/search behavior.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8 and commands schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.50`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.19

- Audited the full Settings Create/Show/Move/Close path after upper-left flashing remained visible through alpha.3.18.
- Identified the remaining upper-left state: the real Settings HWND itself was still born at `rcWork.left/top` and only moved to Center/Last while hidden.
- Added a never-visible 1x1 tool-window DPI probe on the selected target monitor so the real Settings HWND no longer needs a temporary creation position to discover PerMonitorV2 DPI.
- Compute the fixed 820x620 logical client area's exact DPI-aware outer size before creating the real Settings window.
- Compute and clamp the final Center/Last rectangle before real HWND creation.
- Create the actual Settings HWND directly at that final rectangle, eliminating the monitor-origin birth rectangle from USER32/DWM placement state.
- Verify actual HWND DPI and outer size after creation and only perform hidden correction if Windows resolved a different DPI context.
- Keep `PositionForShow()` as a final hidden/current-position clamp, while preserving alpha.3.18 `SW_SHOW` semantics and hide-before-destroy closing.
- Preserve alpha.3.16 update-status repaint reliability, destroy-on-close, About Show-first ordering and all frozen shortcut/search behavior.
- Preserve Settings schemaVersion 8 and commands schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.49`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.18

- Removed the remaining synthetic Settings `SW_HIDE -> SW_SHOWNORMAL` first-show lifecycle.
- Confirmed `RememberSettingsPosition()` only persists coordinates and does not move or refresh the Settings HWND; it was not the source of the close flash.
- Keep hidden Create-time Center/Last positioning through `SetWindowPos`, but no longer call `ShowWindow` during Create.
- Changed the real Settings open path from `SW_SHOWNORMAL` to `SW_SHOW`, so USER32 displays the already-positioned current rectangle instead of restoring a separate normal/original placement.
- Made Settings close visually atomic: capture the visible rectangle first, immediately hide the top-level HWND with `SWP_HIDEWINDOW`, then commit pending changes, persist the captured position and destroy the hidden HWND.
- Prevent USER32/DWM destruction bookkeeping from ever producing a visible final-frame jump back to Center after the user manually moves the window.
- Preserve Centered placement, Last-position behavior, destroy-on-close, About Show-first ordering, alpha.3.16 update-status repaint reliability and all frozen shortcut/search behavior.
- Preserve Settings schemaVersion 8 and commands schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.48`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.17

- Fixed the alpha.3.16 regression where **Settings placement = Centered** consistently opened at the selected monitor's upper-left corner.
- Confirmed the failure was specific to Center mode: Last-position mode worked because its hidden creation point already matched the desired saved normal position.
- Keep explicit non-`CW_USEDEFAULT` creation on the intended monitor for correct initial Per-Monitor-DPI context.
- After final client/outer sizing and layout, resolve Center/Last while the HWND is still hidden and move it to the real final rectangle before any first-show state is consumed.
- Restore the proven hidden `ShowWindow(SW_HIDE)` first-show consumption step, but only after the hidden HWND has already been positioned at its true Center/Last rectangle.
- Remove `SWP_SHOWWINDOW` from `PositionForShow()`; placement now only positions/sizes and never makes the window visible as a side effect.
- On the real open path, re-resolve placement and use `ShowWindow(SW_SHOWNORMAL)` from an already-correct normal position.
- Preserve alpha.3.16's owner-draw update-status repaint fix, destroy-on-close lifecycle, About Show-first ordering, Last-position clamping and all frozen shortcut/search behavior.
- Preserve Settings schemaVersion 8 and commands schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.47`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.16

- Fixed About occasionally remaining visually stuck on **正在检查更新... / Checking for updates...** after the background update check had already completed.
- Identified the stale display as an owner-draw repaint bug: `updateStatus_` is `SS_OWNERDRAW`, so changing its text did not reliably repaint the pixels owned by `DrawUpdateStatus()`.
- Kept the existing update worker, posted status notifications and 250 ms App-owned reconciliation watchdog, but synchronously redraw both the update status surface and action button after every status refresh.
- Removed Settings creation through `CW_USEDEFAULT`, eliminating the native upper-left normal-placement state from every destroy/recreate cycle.
- Create the hidden Settings HWND directly on the intended session monitor so `GetDpiForWindow` starts in the correct Per-Monitor-DPI context.
- Removed the synthetic first `ShowWindow(SW_HIDE)` placement-consumption workaround.
- Changed first visible Settings display to one atomic `SetWindowPos(... SWP_SHOWWINDOW)` using the already resolved Centered/Last rectangle; no separate `SW_SHOWNORMAL` call remains.
- Preserved Centered placement, Last-position persistence/clamping, About's shared Show-first path and destroy-on-close semantics.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8, commands schemaVersion 2, alpha.3.15 Shortcut Editor behavior and all frozen shortcut/search/update-network contracts.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.46`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.15

- Kept Name / Keywords / Target as left-aligned semibold primary labels while demoting inline form labels and Run as administrator to normal Body weight.
- Right-aligned Target type, Runtime input, Test input, Fixed arguments, Working directory and Icon inside one language-aware fixed label column with a deliberate 12-logical-pixel gap before controls.
- Aligned all Runtime/Advanced value controls to the same vertical field origin, including the administrator checkbox.
- Matched File / Folder / Working-directory / Icon browse-button height and vertical position to the native font-derived Edit field height.
- Converted editor browse actions plus Test / Save / Cancel to lightweight owner-drawn buttons; Save is the single accent primary action while the others remain restrained secondary actions.
- Preserved Enter-to-save behavior for native Edit and closed ComboBox controls after changing Save from native default-pushbutton painting to owner-drawn presentation.
- Replaced fixed collapsed/expanded editor-height constants with visible-content measurement plus a fixed 24-logical-pixel gap before the footer.
- Kept Runtime Test and Advanced dynamic resize/redraw hardening while removing the remaining collapsed-state dead space.
- Slightly softened helper-text color without shrinking typography.
- Preserved alpha.3.14 native Edit sizing, alpha.3.13 modern IFileOpenDialog pickers, shortcut schemas and all frozen Settings/Shortcut Manager behavior.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8 and commands schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.45`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.14

- Reduced Shortcut Editor collapsed/expanded geometry to match the real content instead of preserving large blank vertical bands.
- Derived native single-line Edit height from the active Body font metrics, reusing the proven Shortcut Manager search-field strategy so text/caret and borders stay visually balanced across DPI.
- Kept native single-line Win32 Edit controls, IME, tab navigation and keyboard behavior; no multiline or custom-painted Edit replacement was introduced.
- Added restrained native Edit left/right text margins for cleaner typed text and cue-banner spacing.
- Reworked Advanced from stacked label-then-field blocks into compact label/value rows for Fixed arguments, Working directory and Icon.
- Aligned Run as administrator with the Advanced value column and kept Working-directory/Icon browse actions on their existing rows.
- Reduced Runtime-Test expansion to the new compact row rhythm while preserving None/Raw/URL-encoded behavior and the existing redraw hardening.
- Preserved alpha.3.13 modern IFileOpenDialog pickers, owner-drawn Advanced header, Icon auto semantics, shortcut schema/model and all frozen Settings/Shortcut Manager behavior.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8 and commands schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.44`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.13

- Removed the redundant Icon **Auto** button; an empty Icon field already preserves the existing automatic target-icon behavior.
- Expanded the Icon edit field into the freed space and kept only the native **Choose…** action.
- Added modern Windows `IFileOpenDialog` selection for Target files, Target folders, Working directory and Icon sources.
- Used `FOS_PICKFOLDERS` for modern folder selection, replacing the old tree browser during normal Windows 10/11 operation.
- Added localized chooser titles and localized file-filter labels for Chinese/English UI.
- Seeded modern chooser navigation from the current field, or from Target when Working directory/Icon is blank.
- Retained `GetOpenFileNameW` / `SHBrowseForFolderW` as compatibility fallbacks only when the modern shell dialog is unavailable.
- Changed Advanced from a native full-width pushbutton appearance to an owner-drawn lightweight section header with a continuation divider.
- Removed the ineffective alpha.3.12 Button `NM_CUSTOMDRAW` path; regular action buttons remain native and Advanced owns only its explicit `WM_DRAWITEM` presentation.
- Preserved alpha.3.12 compact layout, Runtime Input dynamic resizing, Advanced semantics and all shortcut execution behavior.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8 and commands schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.43`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.3.12

- Consolidated Shortcut Editor presentation without changing shortcut data or execution semantics.
- Increased editor width to 720 logical px while reducing the Advanced-expanded height; Name and Keywords now share the first row.
- Kept Target full-width and converted Target type into a compact metadata row.
- Added a light separator before Runtime Input while preserving the existing None/Raw/URL-encoded behavior and conditional Test input row.
- Changed Advanced into a full-width collapsible header with a subtle continuation line; kept Fixed arguments → Working directory → Icon → Administrator ordering.
- Simplified Working directory and Icon labels and moved their automatic/default guidance into native cue banners.
- Replaced `WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE` Edit fields with flat native `WS_BORDER` fields; native Edit/ComboBox semantics remain intact.
- Applied `ui::kApplicationPalette`, Body/BodySemibold typography, muted helper text and a subtle bottom action surface.
- Kept Test/Cancel secondary and made Save the single accent primary action through native Button custom draw, retaining the existing control IDs and command handling.
- Preserved `RefreshDynamicLayout()` / `ResizeForContent()` behavior and the hardened whole-window redraw path used by Runtime/Advanced toggles.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8, commands schemaVersion 2 and all frozen Shortcut workflow semantics.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.42`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.3.11

- Fixed tray **关于… / About...** opening the shared Settings window at the upper-left while tray **设置… / Settings...** already centered correctly.
- Audited the two entry paths and isolated the difference to `SettingsWindow::ShowAbout()`: it selected `Page::About` before invoking the shared top-level `Show()` lifecycle.
- Changed About to run `Show()` first, so Settings creation, hidden first-show consumption, `PositionForShow()`, minimize restore and foreground activation are now identical to the normal Settings entry.
- Switched to `Page::About` only after the top-level window is shown, removing the last entry-specific placement path.
- Preserved alpha.3.10's `SW_HIDE` first-show consumption, destroy-on-close lifecycle, Last-position persistence and alpha.3.8 update-status reconciliation watchdog.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8 and all frozen Shortcut workflow behavior.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.41`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.3.10

- Re-audited Settings placement against the last known-good alpha.3.6 implementation instead of continuing to layer placement workarounds.
- Identified the alpha.3.7 regression point: removing the end-of-Create `ShowWindow(hwnd_, SW_HIDE)` also removed the call that consumed USER32's native first-show/default-placement state.
- Restored that hidden first `ShowWindow` call while retaining alpha.3.7's destroy-on-close lifecycle.
- Removed the alpha.3.9 explicit creation-monitor anchor and returned Settings creation coordinates to the proven `CW_USEDEFAULT` path.
- Restored first visible open to `PositionForShow()` followed by a single `ShowWindow(SW_SHOWNORMAL)`, with no post-show position pass.
- Kept **上次位置 / Last position** saving on close and all Center/Last work-area clamping logic unchanged.
- Kept alpha.3.8 update-status reconciliation behavior unchanged.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8 and all frozen Shortcut workflow behavior.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.40`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.3.9

- Removed `CW_USEDEFAULT` from Settings top-level window creation after alpha.3.8 real-Windows validation showed native first-show placement could still override the configured location.
- Created the hidden Settings HWND at an explicit point on the intended monitor so its initial DPI context already matches the Center/Last target monitor.
- Used the saved Settings position as the creation anchor for **上次位置 / Last position** and the current mouse monitor work area as the creation anchor for **屏幕居中 / Centered**.
- Changed first display to pre-position hidden → `ShowWindow(SW_SHOWNORMAL)` → post-show position correction, ensuring USER32/default-show and Per-Monitor-DPI negotiation cannot leave Settings at the upper-left cascade position.
- Kept the post-show correction limited to newly hidden/recreated Settings windows; already visible or minimized windows retain their normal session behavior.
- Kept alpha.3.8 update-status reconciliation behavior unchanged.
- Documented that manual update checking is testable without a newer release because a successful check must terminate in Up to date rather than remain in Checking.
- Preserved alpha.3.7 destroy/recreate lifecycle, Settings schemaVersion 8 and all frozen Shortcut workflow behavior.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.39`.
## 0.8.0-alpha.3.8

- Fixed recreated Settings windows ignoring **屏幕居中 / Centered** and **上次位置 / Last position** on tray open.
- Changed first-show placement to one atomic `SetWindowPos(... SWP_SHOWWINDOW)` operation instead of positioning a hidden `CW_USEDEFAULT` window and then calling `ShowWindow(SW_SHOWNORMAL)`.
- Preserved current-mouse-monitor centering and work-area clamping for Last position.
- Recorded the real Settings rectangle again during `WM_CLOSE`, so Last position reflects the previous session even when the user did not finish a drag immediately before closing.
- Added an App-owned 250 ms update reconciliation timer that exists only while the update worker is active.
- Kept existing background update work and posted status messages, with the timer acting only as a missed-notification watchdog.
- Stopped the watchdog as soon as the worker reaches a terminal state and avoided joining a still-running cancelled check when its visible status has already been reset.
- Fixed About occasionally remaining on **正在检查更新… / Checking for updates...** even though reopening Settings immediately revealed the completed update result.
- Preserved alpha.3.7 Settings/Manager destroy lifecycle and all frozen Shortcut workflow behavior.
- Kept Settings schemaVersion 8; updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.38`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.7

- Changed Settings close semantics from hiding the top-level window to destroying it and recreating it on demand.
- Reopening Settings after a real close now starts on **常规 / General** instead of preserving the previous page; re-invoking Settings while it is still open keeps the current page.
- Added explicit Settings instance-state/resource cleanup so Hotkey rows, page-control vectors, fonts, brushes and async callback handles do not accumulate across reopen cycles.
- Changed Shortcut Manager close/Esc semantics from hiding the top-level window to destroying it and recreating it on demand.
- Preserved Shortcut Manager position/size and user-adjusted first-three-column widths across the new destroy/recreate lifecycle while continuing to clear search, selection, focus and scroll context on reopen.
- Kept Shortcut Editor and Path Conversion as short-lived modal windows; both already destroy their HWNDs when closed, so no lifecycle change was required there.
- Simplified shortcut deletion confirmation to **确定要删除“名称”吗？ / Delete “Name”?** plus **删除后无法撤销 / This action cannot be undone**, removing the internal commands.json implementation detail.
- Preserved Shortcut Manager layout, Header drag behavior, context-menu structure, 24px rows, Runtime Input, Path Conversion and all frozen v0.7 behavior.
- Kept Settings schemaVersion 8; updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.37`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.6

- Simplified selected-item Shortcut Manager context-menu labels to **编辑… / Edit...**, **测试 / Test**, **打开所在目录 / Open containing folder**, **复制目标 / Copy target**, and **删除 / Delete**.
- Kept Edit as the context-menu default action and preserved the existing functional grouping/separators.
- Kept blank-area right-click limited to **新建快捷项… / New shortcut...**.
- Renamed the Explorer action from the implementation-oriented **在资源管理器中定位** wording to the user-facing **打开所在目录**.
- Updated the corresponding failure message to match the new action wording.
- Added an explicit Shortcut Editor mode-title helper shared by language refresh and mode initialization.
- Fixed edit dialogs retaining the **新建快捷项 / New shortcut** title because ApplyLanguage previously ran before LoadCommand.
- Ensured new flows show **新建快捷项 / New shortcut** and existing-command flows show **编辑快捷项 / Edit shortcut**.
- Preserved Shortcut Manager layout/resize/search/24px rows and all alpha.3.5 interaction behavior.
- Kept Shortcut Editor form layout, Runtime Input, Advanced Options and Path Conversion behavior unchanged.
- Kept Settings schemaVersion 8; updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.36`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.5

- Removed HDS_FULLDRAG from Shortcut Manager so Header drags use the native tracking guide instead of continuously resizing/repainting the ListView.
- Kept live drag limits by clamping the tracking-guide width without committing ListView columns on every HDN_TRACK.
- Rejected the Header's final one-column native resize and committed the dragged column plus elastic Target once on HDN_ENDTRACK.
- Ordered column commits so Target shrinks first when a source column grows, preventing temporary horizontal overflow and scrollbar flashing.
- Preserved the alpha.3.4 minimum widths and locked elastic Target behavior.
- Centered the first-created Shortcut Manager in the current mouse monitor's work area.
- Added a second center pass after cross-DPI movement so the final DPI-adjusted physical window size remains centered.

- Kept Shortcut Editor and Path Conversion internals unchanged.
- Kept Settings schemaVersion 8; updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.35`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.4

- Enforced Shortcut Manager column limits during Header tracking instead of repairing widths only after drag completion.

- Kept Target as the locked elastic fourth column with a 120-logical-pixel minimum.
- Clamped only the column currently being dragged when a resize would consume Target's minimum space.
- Recomputed Target from the Header's exact client width so all four real columns always fill the visible Header.
- Added HDS_FULLDRAG and handled ANSI + Unicode HDN_ITEMCHANGING / HDN_TRACK / HDN_ITEMCHANGED / HDN_ENDTRACK notifications.
- Routed Header resize constraints through both Manager WM_NOTIFY and the ListView subclass path for real-Windows notification compatibility.
- Guarded programmatic width normalization against recursive Header notifications.
- Prevented manual resizing from collapsing a column to zero or recreating a pseudo-fifth blank Header area / stale selected-row paint.
- Preserved every alpha.3.3 search, reopen, 24px row, free-resize/maximize and frozen v0.7 behavior.
- Kept Shortcut Editor and Path Conversion internals unchanged.
- Kept Settings schemaVersion 8; updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.34`.

- Split Shortcut Manager state into persistent-in-process geometry and transient interaction state.
- Reopening the hidden Manager now keeps its last position/size but clears the search query, selection/focus and list scroll context.
- Reopen no longer auto-selects the first shortcut; Test / Edit / Delete stay disabled until a fresh selection is made.
- Preserved preferred-ID selection for internal create/edit refreshes so workflow continuity is not lost.
- Made Keywords / Name / Type user-resizable while keeping Target as the locked elastic final column.
- Recomputed Target immediately after header resize/double-click and clamped oversized first-three-column layouts so no pseudo-fifth header region can appear.
- Added a full ListView redraw after manual header resizing to clear stale selected-row pixels outside the real four-column area.
- Sized the search EDIT from the active body-font metrics and vertically centered that compact surface in the top control row.
- Changed placeholder drawing to use the EDIT formatting rectangle and forced erase/repaint on EN_CHANGE, eliminating stale placeholder pixels under typed search text.
- Preserved alpha.3.2 24px rows, free resize/maximize, DeferWindowPos resize behavior, selection styling and all frozen v0.7 functional contracts.
- Kept Shortcut Editor and Path Conversion internals unchanged.
- Kept Settings schemaVersion 8; updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.33`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.2

- Reduced the default Manager size from 980×650 to 900×560 logical pixels while keeping free resize, maximize and the 720×480 minimum.
- Reduced shortcut row height from 30 to 24 logical pixels for large collections.
- Replaced the inconsistent native selection rendering with explicit white normal rows and one restrained light-blue selected row.

- Kept Settings schemaVersion 8; updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.32`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.3.1

- Reorganized Shortcut Manager into a top search + primary New action, central dense ListView, and bottom action row.

- Replaced the long filter cue with concise **搜索快捷项 / Search shortcuts**.
- Kept the native four-column table while shortening the Target heading and making the Target column absorb remaining window width.
- Removed heavy ListView grid lines, added 30-logical-pixel rows, restrained separators and shared application selection colors.
- Added concise native empty states for no shortcuts and no search matches.

## 0.8.0-alpha.2.14

- Moved per-item **恢复默认 / Reset** from the auxiliary row to the main Hotkey row immediately left of the capture control.
- Kept Reset as the existing lightweight owner-drawn text action; no bordered button styling was reintroduced.
- Reserved a stable inline Reset column so shortcut capture controls do not move when a binding becomes modified.
- Removed Reset visibility from Hotkey auxiliary-height calculations, so modifying one or all five shortcuts no longer expands cards or pushes Reset-all below the fixed viewport.
- Kept capture guidance and validation/registration errors as the only auxiliary-row content.
- Preserved the alpha.2.13 explicit visibility state and parent-level atomic redraw path.
- Added no Hotkey scrolling because normal modified-binding states now fit the fixed Settings viewport without overflow.

- Removed child-level `WM_SETREDRAW` from dynamic Hotkey layout updates.
- Added explicit per-row `statusVisible/resetVisible` layout state instead of deriving auxiliary height from `WS_VISIBLE`.
- Made Hotkey refresh/status changes atomic at the Settings-parent level: text/visibility changes, layout and final parent+child redraw now happen in one transaction.

- Kept normal Hotkey density, auxiliary styling, Settings schemaVersion 8 and all unrelated Settings pages unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.33`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.2.12

- Added a unified Hotkey capture-cancel lifecycle instead of letting capture persist indefinitely.
- Clicking the active capture button now cancels capture; clicking another capture button switches directly to that action.
- Clicking elsewhere in Settings, leaving the Hotkeys page, deactivating Settings, or closing/hiding Settings now cancels capture.
- Reopening Settings always starts with no active Hotkey capture session.
- Replaced partial parent invalidation after dynamic Hotkey row changes with a full parent + child erase/redraw transaction.
- Removed stale white strips, clipped child controls and residual pixels caused by auxiliary-row expansion/collapse.
- Preserved 54px normal Hotkey rows, auxiliary-state styling and every existing Hotkey Registry/binding/validation/conflict/global-registration contract.

- Added explicit top/bottom padding inside auxiliary rows so helper text no longer touches or crosses row separators.
- Measured wrapped status text at the actual right-side auxiliary width and expanded only the active row as needed.
- Gave capture/error status priority over per-item Reset so auxiliary controls never stack in the same row.
- Kept normal Hotkey rows at 54 logical pixels and preserved capture-button/switch alignment.
- Tightened the Reset-all button's gap below the launcher card without changing its lower-right placement.
- Preserved Settings schemaVersion 8 and every frozen Hotkey Registry/capture/conflict/global-registration contract.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.31`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.2.10

- Reduced normal Hotkey rows from 72 to 54 logical pixels and centered action labels, capture buttons and switches on the same row axis.
- Preserved the empty switch column for required actions so all five capture buttons remain aligned.
- Made per-row status and Reset space conditional; rows expand by 18 logical pixels only when auxiliary content is visible.
- Recomputed Hotkey card geometry immediately when capture/status/reset visibility changes.
- Added inset row separators matching the visual treatment used by other Settings cards.
- Kept Reset-all on the lower-right edge and preserved all Hotkey Registry IDs, capture/validation/conflict/global-registration behavior and Settings schemaVersion 8.

- Replaced the bordered GitHub button with a lightweight `GitHub ↗` text link aligned with the version metadata.
- Tightened the About product block and kept separators between both update settings and the status/action row.
- Decoupled update preferences from update execution: toggling automatic checks no longer starts a check, and toggling prerelease updates only changes the channel for a future check.
- Kept both update switches interactive while a check is running.
- Invalidated and asynchronously cancelled an in-flight check when its prerelease channel changes, discarding stale progress/results without blocking Settings.
- Changed successful manual-check actions back to the stable **检查更新 / Check for updates** label instead of “Check again”.
- Added **尚未按当前设置检查更新 / Updates have not been checked with the current settings** after a channel preference change.

- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.28`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.2.7

- Reworked About into a compact product header plus one 560-logical-pixel Updates card and removed the low-density Project card.
- Replaced the visible Stable / Development channel ComboBox with the user-facing **接收预发布版更新 / Get prerelease updates** switch while preserving the internal update-channel contract.
- Made prerelease updates opt-in by default for every build type; fresh settings and reset defaults now use the Stable channel even when the running build is Alpha, Beta or RC.
- Preserved existing persisted update-channel choices across upgrades.
- Consolidated Check and Download/Install into one state-driven update action with Check again, progress and Retry states.
- Kept channel/preference changes on the existing update-generation reset path so stale check results are discarded and automatic checking refreshes only when enabled.
- Kept Settings schemaVersion 8 and all frozen v0.7 updater safety, rollback, startup-health and publication contracts unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.27`.

## 0.8.0-alpha.2.6

- Replaced the Hotkeys master/detail layout with grouped single-column Global / Launcher hotkey cards and inline binding controls.
- Added per-action inline capture, optional enable switches, conditional per-row Reset actions and per-row validation/registration status without changing Hotkey Registry IDs or behavior.
- Debounced Search source commits for 180 ms so rapid clicks collapse to the final desired state instead of queueing synchronous provider refresh work.
- Batched ordinary discovery-source changes into one Settings save, provider-cache merge, Launcher refresh and provider-refresh request per debounce window.
- Kept Everything as a separate final lifecycle operation so its managed-service/UAC semantics remain unchanged while failed changes restore the actual persisted state.

- Reduced the fixed Settings client viewport from 820×720 to 820×620 logical pixels while keeping General single-column and scrollable.
- Added shared Settings client-width/client-height UI metrics so the fixed viewport is regression-tested instead of duplicated as magic numbers.
- Removed the sidebar navigation `DrawFocusRect` dotted outline; selected navigation keeps its accent treatment and keyboard focus now uses a subtle background state.
- Fixed rapid repeated clicks on owner-drawn Settings switches by accepting both `BN_CLICKED` and `BN_DOUBLECLICKED` as toggle activations.
- Kept the alpha.2.2 3× supersampled/HALFTONE switch rendering and explicit immediate repaint path.

- Reduced Settings toggle rows from 62 to 50 logical pixels and combo rows from 68 to 54 while preserving the 208 logical-pixel sidebar.
- Converted Hotkeys enablement to the same right-side owner-drawn toggle language and kept normal registration status silent unless capture or an error needs attention.
- Simplified Everything status to user-facing state plus actions; technical query details remain available from Diagnostics.
- Sized the default Settings window from a 1080×720 logical client viewport with DPI-aware non-client adjustment instead of treating the outer window as the client area.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 8, Provider IDs/defaults, Hotkey Registry IDs, launcher/search behavior, Everything lifecycle, update/uninstall contracts and Shortcut TSV v3 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.8.0.21`.

- Moved search-result icons from Appearance to General / Launcher behavior.
- Added independent Launcher monitor and placement controls: near top, centered or last position.
- Added Settings window placement control: centered or last position; remembered positions are clamped to available monitor work areas.
- Added a small Modern Compact launcher drag strip so remembered Launcher positioning works without changing its input-first interaction.
- Converted Hotkeys to a two-column card layout with a two-line owner-drawn action list.
- Split Search sources into application providers and an Everything file/folder card with simplified status hierarchy.
- Moved the data-directory entry from About to Data and reorganized Data, Diagnostics and About into the shared Settings visual system.
- Removed the permanently hidden legacy General-page hotkey controls and routing.
- Bumped settings schemaVersion from 7 to 8 for persisted window-placement preferences/state; schema 7 -> 8 migration keeps existing behavior with Launcher=top and Settings=center.

- Added `V0.7_RC_VALIDATION.md` as the final clean-install, `beta.12 -> rc.1` native-update, regression, platform, packaging and Stable-promotion gate.
- Froze settings schemaVersion 7, commands schemaVersion 2, usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2 and Shortcut TSV v3.
- Froze current Provider IDs, Hotkey Registry action IDs, Classic launcher geometry, update behavior, Native Uninstall behavior and Managed Everything ownership/lifecycle.
- Kept the portable helper contract `ALTRunNext.exe`, `Update.exe`, `Uninstall.exe`; the obsolete `ALTRunNext.Updater.exe` remains prohibited.
- Added the RC validation document to both main and tag-release packages and to the exact package allowlist.
- Reused the full beta.12 automated release contract for rc.1 and added RC-specific gate checks; no new runtime feature was introduced.

- Renamed the Launcher Provider/file promotion action to `Add to shortcuts...` / `添加到快捷项...`.
- Renamed the Explorer file-operation label to `Open containing folder` / `打开所在目录`.
- Reorganized Launcher context menus so execution, shortcut management, file operations and destructive actions are grouped consistently.
- Added `Run as administrator` for eligible application, user-shortcut and executable-file results without changing persisted shortcut settings.
- Direct folder results no longer show the redundant containing-folder action.
- Kept the existing Add-to-shortcuts seed behavior: discovered name/target are preserved while the normal New shortcut editor starts with an empty focused keyword field.
- Changed command merge to canonicalize Provider-vs-Provider duplicates before applying user shortcuts, preventing suppressed lower Provider entries from reviving after promotion.
- Added a TeamSpeak-style regression where a Start Menu `.lnk` is promoted to `ts3` and the lower App Paths `.exe` remains suppressed.
- Extended prerelease ordering coverage to `beta.11 < beta.12 < rc.1`.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.111.

## 0.7.0-beta.11

- Resets result selection whenever the launcher edit control emits `EN_CHANGE`, so each changed query selects its newly best-ranked row.
- Fixes shortcut/result ids staying selected while their rank moves from row 1 to a lower row as the user continues typing.
- Fixes backspace/manual query clearing following the old selected id into the empty-query default list.
- Preserves current selection for asynchronous Everything/dynamic refreshes when the query text itself has not changed.

- Extends prerelease ordering coverage to `beta.10 < beta.11 < rc.1`.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.110.

## 0.7.0-beta.10

- Resets stale result selection when a fresh launcher invocation clears the previous query.
- Clears the list selection before `SetWindowTextW` so the synchronous `EN_CHANGE` rebuild deterministically selects row 1.
- Keeps in-session selection preservation for asynchronous Everything/dynamic-result refreshes.
- Leaves reopen behavior unchanged when Clear query on show is disabled.
- Extends prerelease ordering coverage to `beta.9 < beta.10 < rc.1`.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.109.

## 0.7.0-beta.9

- Filters stale Windows App Paths registry entries whose resolved executable target no longer exists.

- Preserves valid Start Menu/PATH/packaged-app discovery and existing provider ranking/merge behavior.
- Adds Windows provider smoke coverage for live App Paths targets and old-cache stale-entry suppression.
- Extends prerelease ordering coverage to `beta.8 < beta.9 < rc.1`.
- Keeps settings schema 7, commands schema 2, usage schema 1, provider-cache schema 2 and Shortcut TSV v3 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.108.

## 0.7.0-beta.8

- Fixed the Beta 7 high-probability full-uninstall timeout/error 1460 caused by acquiring a broker DELETE lease while Explorer was enumerating the installation folder from its immediate parent.
- Explorer now parks one level farther away from the installation root, with a Windows temporary-directory fallback for layouts where no distinct grandparent exists.
- Removed root DELETE-lease acquisition from the normal-integrity broker; the elevated worker now owns the single destructive lease.
- The broker signals Shell release immediately, preventing the ReleaseDone/1460 timeout cascade seen when the broker lease could not be acquired.
- The elevated worker acquires the root lease before any installation-tree deletion and keeps it through precise child cleanup and final handle-based root deletion.
- Root lease failures now query Restart Manager for possible lock owners as well as reporting the exact root path/error.
- Kept the reboot-delete fallback removed and preserved UAC-cancel, preserve-data, Stable update and Managed Everything ownership semantics.
- Extended Beta validation and prerelease ordering coverage for `beta.7 < beta.8 < rc.1`.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.107.

## 0.7.0-beta.7

- Added a continuous DELETE-access lease handoff between the normal-integrity Explorer broker and elevated TEMP uninstaller.
- The broker now holds a DELETE-capable installation-root handle until the elevated worker confirms it acquired its own matching handle, closing the intermittent shell race window.
- Full-remove acquires the root lease before deleting installation-tree entries, so a lease failure no longer leaves an otherwise empty outer folder.
- The elevated worker keeps the root lease through child cleanup and deletes the empty root with `SetFileInformationByHandle(FileDispositionInfo)` instead of reopening the path for the final delete.
- Kept synchronous entry-by-entry child cleanup, precise failure-path diagnostics, Restart Manager lock-owner reporting and foreground completion dialogs.
- Kept the reboot-delete fallback removed and preserved UAC-cancel, preserve-data, Stable update and Managed Everything ownership semantics.
- Extended Beta validation and prerelease ordering coverage for `beta.6 < beta.7 < rc.1`.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.106.

## 0.7.0-beta.6

- Reworked full-remove Native Uninstall into a normal-integrity Explorer broker plus elevated TEMP worker handshake.
- UAC now appears before Explorer is moved away from the portable installation directory.
- The elevated worker requests Explorer release only immediately before final installation-tree deletion.
- The normal-integrity broker acknowledges the release request, exits, and the elevated worker waits for that exact parent PID before deleting the original `Uninstall.exe` and root directory.
- Cancelling UAC leaves the user's Explorer location unchanged.
- Preserved Beta 5's synchronous entry-by-entry deletion, precise failing-path diagnostics and Restart Manager lock-owner reporting; no whole-tree reboot deletion fallback was reintroduced.
- Preserve-data uninstall retains the simpler parent-exit behavior.
- Extended Beta desktop validation and prerelease ordering coverage for `beta.5 < beta.6 < rc.1`.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.105.

## 0.7.0-beta.5

- Replaced full-root `std::filesystem::remove_all()` cleanup with entry-by-entry file/directory removal so failures identify the exact locked object.
- Detects Explorer windows/tabs currently viewing the ALTRun installation tree and navigates them to the parent directory before root deletion.
- Adds a second best-effort Explorer release pass in the elevated TEMP uninstaller before full removal.
- Uses Windows Restart Manager to report possible locking application/PID information for regular files that remain locked after bounded retries.
- Removed the Beta 4 fallback that deferred the remaining installation tree wholesale to the next system reboot.
- Preserved exact-install and Managed Everything ownership boundaries and existing foreground/topmost completion dialogs.
- Extended Beta desktop validation and prerelease ordering coverage for `beta.4 < beta.5 < rc.1`.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.104.

## 0.7.0-beta.4

- Fixed Stable-channel update checks against legacy stable releases that do not contain `update-manifest.json`: HTTP 404 now falls back to GitHub latest-stable release metadata instead of surfacing as a system error.
- Added a non-downgrade Stable-channel status when the running beta is newer than the latest stable release.
- Preserved the checksum/manifest update path for future stable releases; a newer legacy stable without a manifest is reported as manual-update-required rather than downloaded unsafely.
- Hardened Native Uninstall full-remove cleanup so persistently locked owned files can be queued with `MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT` after bounded retries.
- Kept deferred deletion strictly inside the already validated ALTRun installation/Managed Everything ownership boundary.
- Made final Native Uninstall success and failure dialogs foreground/topmost so they are not hidden behind other desktop windows.
- Extended Beta desktop validation and prerelease ordering coverage for `beta.3 < beta.4 < rc.1`.
- Kept all v0.7 schemas, Provider/Hotkey IDs and Managed Everything lifecycle semantics frozen.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.103.

## 0.7.0-beta.3

- Hardened Native Uninstall full-remove cleanup against transient Windows sharing/lock/access-denied/directory-not-empty/busy failures with bounded retry.
- Preserved exact ownership boundaries: only the current ALTRun Next installation and ALTRun-owned Managed Everything service/process paths are eligible for cleanup.
- Fixed uninstall error reporting so filesystem deletion failures propagate their actual native error instead of reusing a stale `GetLastError()` value.
- Added the failed removal path to the error dialog when cleanup still cannot complete after retries.
- Kept preserve-data behavior unchanged: user state remains while Managed Everything, update runtime state and application files are removed.
- Extended the v0.7 Beta validation checklist with the full-remove retry/diagnostic regression discovered on real Windows.
- Extended prerelease ordering coverage to `beta.2 < beta.3 < rc.1`.
- Kept all v0.7 frozen schemas, Provider/Hotkey IDs and Managed Everything lifecycle semantics unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.102.

## 0.7.0-beta.2

- Fixed the blank Working Directory browse button in the Shortcut Editor by assigning a localized `选择... / Browse...` label and a usable compact width.
- Fixed stale paint trails after changing Runtime Input mode, including the horizontal line that could remain across the Test button.
- Fixed severe Shortcut Editor visual corruption when Runtime Input changed while Advanced options were already expanded.
- Unified Runtime Input and Advanced dynamic layout transitions through a final resize/layout/full erase-and-redraw pass instead of relying on a sequence of child `MoveWindow` repaints.
- Suppressed intermediate parent redraw during programmatic content-height changes so the final layout paints atomically.
- Added Beta validation regressions for Working Directory browse labeling and repeated Runtime Input switching in both collapsed and expanded Advanced states.
- Kept all v0.7 Beta frozen schemas, Provider/Hotkey IDs, updater/uninstaller contracts and Managed Everything behavior unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.101.

## 0.7.0-beta.1

- Entered v0.7 feature freeze: no new user-facing feature or persisted schema is added in Beta 1.
- Froze settings schemaVersion 7, commands schemaVersion 2, usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2 and Shortcut TSV v3 as the v0.7 compatibility baseline.
- Froze current Provider IDs, Hotkey Registry action IDs, Classic launcher geometry and the portable helper names `ALTRunNext.exe`, `Update.exe`, `Uninstall.exe`.
- Added `shortcut_compatibility_tests` covering TSV v1, TSV v2, TSV v3, legacy five-column import, Unicode/portable paths, legacy enabled/pinned normalization and v3 export/import round-trip.
- Extended UpdatePolicy regression coverage for `alpha.9.4 -> beta.1 -> beta.2 -> rc.1 -> stable` and downgrade rejection.
- Added packaged `V0.7_BETA_VALIDATION.md` for real Windows update, shortcut workflow, Runtime Input, Path Conversion, icons, Context Actions, Everything ownership/lifecycle, Uninstall, DPI and performance sign-off.
- Preserved alpha.9.4 Managed Everything behavior without redesign: normal app exit keeps an enabled owned service warm; provider disable stops/disables only an owned service; external Everything remains untouched.
- Kept final visual redesign and non-blocking performance polish deferred until the functional surface is proven stable.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.100.

## 0.7.0-alpha.9.4

- Made the Everything provider checkbox manage the full lifecycle only for ALTRun-owned Managed Everything.
- Disabling the provider now closes the managed client, stops the owned Everything Windows Service and changes its startup type to `SERVICE_DISABLED`, preventing it from returning on the next Windows boot.
- Re-enabling an owned managed installation restores `SERVICE_AUTO_START`, starts the service, then starts the managed client.
- Kept normal ALTRun Next exit unchanged: only the managed client exits; an enabled managed service remains warm.
- Added strict service ImagePath ownership checks so external/user-installed Everything services are never stopped or reconfigured.
- Added an elevated `--set-managed-everything-service enabled|disabled` maintenance entrypoint and transactional provider-toggle handling; cancelling UAC keeps the prior provider setting.
- The alpha.9.1 detached service host is still recognized as ALTRun-owned and can be retargeted back to the portable managed path during service-policy transitions.
- Updated Search Sources explanatory text to distinguish normal application exit from explicitly disabling the Everything provider.
- Added lifecycle regression coverage for exact managed-service executable ownership.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 7, commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.94.

## 0.7.0-alpha.9.3

- Removed the temporary `ALTRunNext.Updater.exe` compatibility copy from x64/ARM64 packages.
- Standardized the portable helper contract on `Update.exe` and `Uninstall.exe` only.
- Removed first-start legacy-updater cleanup because the obsolete filename is no longer shipped.
- Updated package allowlists, runtime smoke tests, CI/release packaging and release contracts to reject the legacy helper from current packages.
- Development upgrade from alpha.9/alpha.9.1 is intentionally manual; no legacy updater-name compatibility is retained.
- Kept the alpha.9.2 portable Managed Everything, auto-start service and native uninstaller design unchanged.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 7, commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.93.

## 0.7.0-alpha.9.2

- Restored Managed Everything to ALTRun Next's portable `data/tools/Everything` tree; no new permanent Program Files host is used.
- Kept the Everything Windows Service `SERVICE_AUTO_START` and running across normal ALTRun Next exit so the index stays warm and later launcher starts do not need repeated UAC.
- Kept the managed Everything client session-scoped: actual ALTRun Next exit still closes only the owned client.
- Added alpha.9.1 compatibility migration: the temporary `%ProgramFiles%\Aspeternity\ALTRunNext\EverythingService` host is detected as ALTRun-owned, retargeted back to the current portable managed executable through the explicit elevated repair flow, then cleaned up.
- Renamed the packaged native update helper to `Update.exe`.
- Added `Uninstall.exe`: self-copies to TEMP, prompts whether to preserve user data, elevates once, closes the exact ALTRun Next installation, stops/deletes only owned Managed Everything service state, removes managed runtime/update files, and removes application files.
- Uninstall ownership protection leaves healthy external/user-installed Everything services untouched.
- When user data is preserved, `data/settings.json`, shortcuts, usage and other user state remain; Managed Everything and `data/update` are still removed.
- Added a one-release `ALTRunNext.Updater.exe` compatibility copy in release ZIPs so alpha.9/alpha.9.1 can stage alpha.9.2; alpha.9.2 deletes the installed legacy helper name on first startup.
- Updated Windows CI/package contracts for `Update.exe`, `Uninstall.exe`, the transition bridge, and Windows 10 compatibility builds.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 7, commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.92.

## 0.7.0-alpha.9.1

- Fixed old portable ALTRun Next folders remaining locked after exit because the persistent Everything Windows Service was still executing `Everything.exe -svc` from that folder.
- Separated the managed client and service lifetimes: the client stays in portable `data/tools/Everything`, while the ALTRun-owned service host is copied to the protected `%ProgramFiles%\Aspeternity\ALTRunNext\EverythingService\<version-arch>` location.
- Detect a live legacy ALTRun-managed service ImagePath and require an explicit one-time migration instead of treating a running service as automatically healthy.
- The elevated maintenance flow can install the service from the protected host, or stop/retarget/restart an existing legacy/stale managed service and wait for both stop/start completion.
- Healthy external/user-installed Everything services remain ownership-protected and are never retargeted.
- Local Recheck remains non-elevating; migration/repair still occurs only after the user explicitly chooses Get and start Everything and confirms UAC.
- Added Windows lifecycle regression coverage proving the persistent service host is outside the portable ALTRun Next data tree.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 7, commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- This build is also the intended real-world native updater target for alpha.9 -> alpha.9.1 validation.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.91.

## 0.7.0-alpha.9

- Added native Stable / Development update channels to Settings → About.
- Added default-on automatic update checks throttled to at most once per 24 hours plus explicit manual checks.
- Prerelease builds default to Development; stable builds default to Stable.
- Added release `update-manifest.json` generation with version, commit, architecture-specific asset names and SHA-256 values.
- Added native WinHTTP manifest/package download, architecture selection, BCrypt SHA-256 verification and staged Windows Shell ZIP extraction.
- Added packaged `ALTRunNext.Updater.exe`, copied to `%TEMP%` before applying so the updater can replace itself safely.
- Added transactional application-file backup/apply/rollback while explicitly preserving the portable `data/` directory.
- Added post-update startup health-event confirmation; launch/health failure rolls files back and relaunches the previous version.
- Protected install directories elevate only the updater; the restarted main application uses the normal Explorer token when available.
- Update downloads/installation remain explicitly user-driven; automatic checking never silently installs an update.
- Advanced settings.json to schemaVersion 7 for `update.autoCheck` and `update.channel`; commands/usage/provider-cache/TSV schemas remain unchanged.
- Added update policy/manifest regression coverage and Windows CI/package gates for the updater helper.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.90.

## 0.7.0-alpha.8.4

- Fixed Everything Service startup error 2 when a persistent stopped service still points to an old/moved ALTRun Next managed Everything executable.
- Query the real Windows service ImagePath before starting a stopped Everything Service.
- Classify a missing service executable as stale and keep local Recheck non-elevating.
- Added one-shot elevated ALTRun Next maintenance mode to retarget the existing Everything service to the current managed `Everything.exe -svc`, restore automatic start and start the service with one UAC confirmation.
- Healthy running services and stopped services with a valid executable continue to be reused; healthy external/user-installed Everything services are not rewritten.
- Added service ImagePath parser regression coverage for quoted/unquoted paths and paths containing spaces.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 6, commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.84.

## 0.7.0-alpha.8.3

- Added ownership-safe Managed Everything shutdown on real ALTRun Next process exit.
- Disabling the Everything search source now cancels/joins any bootstrap worker, invalidates stale completion messages, stops query work, and exits the managed Everything client.
- The Windows Everything Service is deliberately left running across ALTRun Next exit/disable so future startup does not require repeated elevation.
- Added exact executable-path ownership verification before issuing Everything's `-exit`; external/user-installed Everything instances are never closed by the managed lifecycle.
- Added `ManagedEverythingStopStatus` / `StopManagedEverything` runtime API and Windows regression coverage for missing/not-running/external-ownership cases.
- Updated Search Sources help text to document managed-client shutdown versus persistent service behavior.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 6, commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.83.

## 0.7.0-alpha.8.2

- Fixed freshly managed Everything reporting IPC-ready while NTFS indexing was blocked by the first-run access-denied dialog.
- Added managed-runtime configuration for local data, standard-user operation, background mode, hidden tray icon, disabled update checks and IPC enabled.
- Added Windows Everything-service detection with start-pending handling before managed IPC is considered healthy.
- Explicit Get-and-start now installs/starts the official Everything Service with one UAC prompt only when required; local Recheck never elevates.
- Added safe managed-instance ownership detection and graceful `-exit` restart when a managed alpha.8.x process must be reconfigured.
- Existing unrelated Everything installations keep their own settings and service behavior.
- Added managed-INI regression coverage and release-contract checks for service/UAC/headless behavior.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 6, commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.82.

## 0.7.0-alpha.8.1

- Fixed Managed Everything extraction failing with native error 2147500037 / 0x80004005 on real Windows systems.
- Root cause: the verified archive still had the temporary `.zip.download` extension when passed to the Windows Shell ZIP namespace.
- Keep downloaded/unverified bytes under `.zip.download`, SHA-256 verify them first, then atomically rename the verified package to its real `.zip` filename before extraction.
- Clean both staging names across download/hash/staging/extraction failure paths.
- Added a dedicated `PackageStagingFailed` diagnostic and a regression policy test that requires the Shell-facing archive name to end in `.zip`.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 6, commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.81.

## 0.7.0-alpha.8

- Replaced the Everything download-page handoff with Managed Everything Bootstrap.
- Added local-first discovery of a managed copy, App Paths registrations, Program Files installs and PATH before any download is considered.
- Automatically starts an existing Everything copy in the background when the Everything source is enabled, without network access.
- Added explicit user confirmation before fetching a missing copy; no silent first-time download occurs.
- Fetches the official stable Everything 1.4.1.1032 standard portable ZIP for x64/ARM64 from voidtools and never selects Lite packages.
- Fetches the official SHA-256 manifest, calculates the package SHA-256 with Windows BCrypt and rejects mismatched or unlisted archives.
- Downloads through native WinHTTP to a temporary .download file and extracts with the Windows Shell ZIP namespace under data/tools/Everything.
- Starts the managed portable copy with -startup -first-instance and waits for an Everything IPC endpoint before reporting Ready.
- Runs discovery/download/verification/extraction/startup on a dedicated worker thread and surfaces progress/failure state in Search Sources.
- Recheck remains local-only and never downloads; application-search fallback remains available while Everything is unavailable.
- Added portable package/checksum parsing regression coverage and kept the existing Everything IPC compatibility behavior.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 6, commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.80.

## 0.7.0-alpha.7

- Added context-sensitive Launcher result menus instead of a single copied classic menu.
- User shortcuts expose Run, Edit shortcut, filesystem reveal when applicable, Copy target and destructive Delete at the bottom.
- Discovered Application/File/Folder results can be added as pre-filled user shortcuts; Everything folders also expose current Explorer/Total Commander navigation when activation context is available.
- URL and Smart Action context menus remain minimal and action-specific.
- Added Shortcut Manager row menus with Edit, Test, optional File Explorer reveal, Copy target and Delete; blank-list context offers New shortcut only.
- Added Windows mouse right-click plus keyboard context-menu invocation support.
- Added pre-filled Shortcut Editor creation while leaving the user-facing Keywords field empty.
- Added platform-independent ContextActions policy and regression coverage for user/discovered/folder/web/packaged-result behavior and shortcut seeding.
- Added a Windows ShellActions helper for resolving portable/PATH-backed filesystem targets and revealing them with File Explorer.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 6, commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.70.

## 0.7.0-alpha.6

- Completed the Shortcut Manager workflow with a local filter across shortcut keywords, aliases, names and targets.
- Show the complete comma-separated shortcut keyword set in the manager instead of exposing only the persisted primary keyword.
- Replaced primary-keyword-only conflict warnings with case-insensitive conflict detection across every keyword and alias, including the exact conflicting token and shortcut name.
- Removed Pause shortcut and Pinned from the Shortcut Editor because temporary disable/manual ordering are not part of the product workflow.
- Normalized legacy user-command enabled/pinned values to active/non-pinned during load, create, update and TSV import while retaining the schemaVersion 2 and TSV v3 compatibility fields.
- Added regression coverage for alias conflicts, manager filtering and legacy pause/pin normalization.
- Updated the roadmap to reflect the actual v0.7 Shortcut / Launcher workflow line and moved distribution/extensibility work to a later phase.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 6, commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.60.

## 0.7.0-alpha.5.2

- Moved result-icon file/PATH/Shell resolution completely off the Launcher UI/WM_DRAWITEM thread.
- Added one lazy background icon worker with a protected job/completion queue and WM_APP completion notification.
- Added search-generation + icon-epoch stamps so stale icon completions are destroyed instead of repainting or populating the current query.
- Cancelled queued obsolete icon jobs as the search generation advances while allowing already-running work to finish safely in the background.
- Replaced per-query icon-cache destruction with a 96-entry cross-query LRU cache keyed by icon source + requested pixel size.
- Added negative-cache entries for failed icon resolutions so unresolved sources do not repeatedly hit Windows Shell APIs.
- Invalidates only result rows that use a newly completed icon instead of repainting the whole Launcher.
- Preserved the default-off zero-resolution path from alpha.5.1; the worker is created lazily only after an enabled icon cache miss.
- Added platform-independent icon pipeline policy tests for cache-key sizing, stale generations, epochs, disabled mode and bounded cache capacity.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 6, commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.52.

## 0.7.0-alpha.5.1

- Added Appearance -> Show search result icons as a persisted, default-off preference.
- Moved result-icon presentation from mandatory behavior to an opt-in visual feature while retaining all per-shortcut custom icon metadata.
- Gated icon handling before portable-path resolution, PATH lookup and Windows Shell/icon APIs so the disabled path performs no icon resolution or caching.
- Restored the pre-icon text geometry in both Classic and Modern result rows when icons are disabled instead of leaving an empty icon gutter.
- Added immediate runtime switching: disabling icons clears/destroys the current icon cache and redraws the list; enabling redraws and resolves icons only as rows are painted.
- Advanced settings.json from schemaVersion 5 to 6 with `appearance.showResultIcons=false` as the migration/default value and schema-5 downgrade read-only protection.
- Added settings persistence, schema-5 -> 6 upgrade, downgrade, clean-install and packaged-runtime migration coverage.
- Kept commands schemaVersion 2, TSV v3, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Deferred asynchronous icon loading to the final performance-polish phase.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.51.

## 0.7.0-alpha.5

- Exposed the existing user-command icon field in the standalone Shortcut Editor with Choose and Auto/reset actions.
- Added custom icon source support for `.ico`, `.exe`, `.dll` and `.lnk` files while keeping blank as target-derived Auto.
- Propagated command icon metadata into normal, runtime-input and legacy web-search Launcher results.
- Added Classic/Modern launcher icon rendering with shell/executable/icon-file resolution and current-result-set handle cleanup.
- Added a context-sensitive Test input field for dynamic shortcuts and routed editor tests through the same runtime-input execution path as Launcher execution.
- Added test-time validation for missing runtime placeholders and empty dynamic test input.
- Extended Path Conversion to include custom icon paths in the same atomic Target/Working Directory batch.
- Advanced shortcut TSV interchange to v3 with an appended `icon` column while retaining older v1/v2 import compatibility.
- Added custom-icon JSON/TSV round-trip, runtime/web result icon propagation and atomic path-update regression coverage.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 5, commands schemaVersion 2, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.50.

## 0.7.0-alpha.4

- Added first-class dynamic Runtime input for user shortcuts with None, Pass through and UTF-8 URL-encoded modes.
- Added the canonical `{input}` placeholder across target, fixed arguments and working directory; retained legacy `{query}` as a compatibility alias.
- Added exact case-insensitive keyword/alias + argument-tail matching so runtime arguments are not treated as fuzzy-search terms.
- Application and Command line shortcuts can auto-append runtime input after fixed arguments when no placeholder is present; URL and Folder shortcuts require explicit placement.
- Routed runtime input through LauncherAction payload into the normal command launch path, after `{folder}` substitution and before portable-path/environment resolution.
- Added Runtime input controls, contextual guidance and invalid-template validation to the Shortcut Editor.
- Advanced commands.json to schemaVersion 2 with persisted `runtimeInputMode`, atomic schema-1 migration and downgrade read-only protection.
- Automatically migrates legacy schema-1 URL `{query}` shortcuts to UTF-8 URL-encoded runtime input.
- Advanced shortcut TSV export/examples to v2 with an appended runtimeInputMode column while retaining older TSV import compatibility.
- Added RuntimeInput, commands-schema migration and legacy-WebAction ownership regression tests.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 5, usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.40.

## 0.7.0-alpha.3.1

- Reworked New/Edit Shortcut around user tasks instead of exposing the internal Command structure directly.
- Merged primary keyword + aliases into one comma-separated Keywords field while preserving the existing persisted primary/alias model.
- Made Name optional with automatic target-based suggestion and manual override.
- Added separate File and Folder target pickers.
- Added Auto detect as the default command-type mode while retaining explicit Application, URL, Folder and Command line overrides.
- Moved fixed arguments, working directory, administrator, pinned and pause controls behind a collapsible Advanced section.
- Reframed enabled state as the user-facing Pause this shortcut option without changing the stored enabled boolean.
- Added automatic target-directory working directory for user Application/Command line shortcuts when the advanced working-directory field is blank.
- Added ShortcutEditorModel + regression tests for keyword parsing, type inference, title suggestion and automatic working-directory rules.
- Kept every persisted schema unchanged; dynamic runtime input/parameter encoding remains deferred to the next feature version.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.31.

## 0.7.0-alpha.3

- Reorganized New/Edit Shortcut into compact Shortcut and Launch options groups instead of the previous oversized flat form.
- Reordered the primary workflow to keyword, name, aliases, type and target before launch-specific fields.
- Fixed the Win32 command-type ComboBox dropdown height so all four existing types are visible: Application, URL, Folder and Command line.
- Added a four-item minimum-visible dropdown contract and immediate type-change handling.
- Disabled the local target browse button for URL commands while retaining browsing for other command types.
- Added release-contract coverage for the grouped editor structure and four command-type options.
- Kept all persisted schemas and Provider/Pinyin/search behavior unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.30.

## 0.7.0-alpha.2.6

- Fixed the blank Pinyin search row in General -> Search behavior.
- Routed `kIdPinyinSearch` through the Settings owner-draw path and added its title/description to `DrawGeneralToggle`.
- Added a release-contract regression gate for both owner-draw routing and Pinyin-row content.
- Kept Provider storage deduplication, Pinyin runtime behavior and settings schemaVersion 5 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.26.

## 0.7.0-alpha.2.5

- Removed the long-lived raw Provider `providerCommands_` vector; Provider cache Commands now exist only during merge and the final searchable `commands_` vector remains resident.
- Added temporary `const Command*` Provider merge views so rebuilding the merged index does not create another full Provider copy.
- Preserved raw Provider count diagnostics as a scalar and kept Provider accepted/suppressed statistics, refresh behavior, command indexes and user override semantics unchanged.
- Added a default-on Pinyin search toggle to General -> Search behavior.
- Disabled Pinyin search now bypasses Hanzi-to-pinyin matching; turning it off also releases a loaded converter and Pinyin cache, while re-enabling stays lazy.
- Advanced settings.json from schemaVersion 4 to 5 for the persisted `behavior.pinyinSearch` preference with schema-4 -> 5 migration and schema-4 downgrade read-only protection.
- Added merge-view, Pinyin-disabled/unload/reload, settings persistence/migration and five-row Search behavior layout regression coverage.
- Kept commands/usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.25.

## 0.7.0-alpha.2.4

- Fresh startup now reports Pinyin not loaded with an empty cache while retaining a side-effect-free dictionary availability check.
- Preserved ASCII pinyin lookup of Chinese commands, including `weixin -> 微信`, initials and hybrid pinyin matching.
- Added synchronization around lazy converter state and cache diagnostics so search and Diagnostics reads cannot race initialization/cache mutation.
- Added regression coverage for unloaded startup, first pinyin search loading, non-empty post-search cache, and missing-dictionary fallback.
- Kept Provider storage, Pinyin cache policy, search scoring/ranking and all persisted schemas unchanged for a clean memory A/B.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.24.

## 0.7.0-alpha.2.3

- Added live Diagnostics-page process memory counters: Working Set, Peak Working Set and Private Bytes.
- Added runtime search/storage baseline counters for user commands, raw Provider commands and merged searchable commands.
- Added Pinyin converter loaded/ready state and cache-entry count diagnostics.
- Added Provider refresh and Provider monitor runtime-state diagnostics.
- Added a reusable Windows ProcessMemory platform layer plus process_memory_tests on Windows smoke/compatibility CI.
- Kept memory diagnostics passive: no EmptyWorkingSet, SetProcessWorkingSetSize or other active working-set trimming.
- Kept Pinyin initialization, Provider storage, search behavior and all persisted schemas unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.23.

## 0.7.0-alpha.2.2

- Replaced the alpha.2.1 repeated-row presentation with true structural shortcut header rows.
- Added full-width custom-drawn shortcut headers using system colors and a semibold system font.
- Removed the redundant Shortcut data column; data rows now show Field, Current path, Converted and Status.
- Indented Target and Working Directory rows beneath each shortcut header while keeping their checkboxes independent.
- Prevented structural header rows from selection, checkbox state changes and path-application batches.
- Kept the current Common Controls version and all alpha.2 conversion/persistence semantics unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.22.

## 0.7.0-alpha.2.1

- Grouped path-conversion preview rows by shortcut without changing the global Common Controls version.
- Show the shortcut label only on the first convertible field row; subsequent Target/Working Directory rows in the same shortcut group leave the Shortcut cell blank.
- Kept Target and Working Directory independently selectable.
- Updated the footer to report convertible shortcut count and convertible field count.
- Kept alpha.2 path-conversion semantics and all persisted schemas unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.21.

## 0.7.0-alpha.2

- Removed Shortcut Manager Move Up / Move Down UI while preserving the internal sortOrder compatibility field.
- Added Path conversion preview/apply workflow for shortcut Target and Working Directory fields.
- Added portable conversion to nearby ALTRun Next-relative paths and known Windows environment-variable paths.
- Added reverse expansion from relative/environment-variable paths to current-machine absolute paths.
- Defined runtime resolution of structured relative Target paths and relative Working Directory paths against the ALTRunNext.exe directory while preserving bare shell-command lookup.
- Left Arguments, URL and UNC targets unchanged by path conversion.
- Added atomic multi-shortcut path updates with rollback on validation/save failure.
- Fixed blank Shortcut Manager list headers by assigning header text at column creation.
- Added Windows path portability tests and cross-platform atomic path-update tests to CI.
- Kept commands.json schemaVersion 1 and all v0.6 persisted/provider/Hotkey/Everything/Smart Actions contracts unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.2.

## 0.7.0-alpha.1

- Added a dedicated Shortcut Manager window with add, edit, delete, test, move-up and move-down operations.
- Added a reusable Shortcut Editor dialog for creating/editing one user shortcut without depending on SettingsWindow.
- Added a system-tray Shortcut Manager entry and simplified the tray around launcher, shortcut management, settings, reload, about and exit.
- Removed the visible Shortcuts navigation/page from Settings and made General the default Settings page.
- Reordered Settings navigation to General, Hotkeys, Appearance, Search sources, Data, Diagnostics, About, placing Diagnostics immediately above About.
- Kept commands.json at schemaVersion 1; existing v0.6 shortcuts require no migration.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 4, commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2 and all v0.6 provider/Hotkey/Everything/Smart Actions contracts unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to 0.7.0.1.

## 0.6.0

- Promoted the validated v0.6.0-rc.1 contract to Stable with no user-facing runtime behavior changes.
- Shipped centralized customizable Hotkeys, Smart Actions, Explorer/Open-Save/Total Commander context navigation, {folder}/{query} templates, Web/URL and clipboard/text actions, optional Everything filesystem search and runtime Diagnostics.
- Kept upgrade/downgrade hardening and release gates from RC.1: clean install, schema 3 -> 4 migration, schema 4 compatibility, downgrade read-only protection, packaged schema 2 -> 4 runtime migration, Windows 10 baseline and desktop/runtime smoke.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 4, commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2, frozen provider defaults/IDs, five Hotkey Registry IDs, Everything Query2/WM_COPYDATA contract, Smart Actions semantics, Diagnostics routing and Classic 420/16/10 geometry.

- Hardened packaged x64 runtime smoke to require successful schema 2 -> 4 migration, all five frozen Hotkey Registry action IDs and Everything opt-in preservation.
- Added `V0.6_RC_VALIDATION.md` to release packages and made it part of the package allowlist.
- RC release-contract now freezes settings/commands/usage/provider-cache schemas, provider IDs/defaults, Hotkey IDs, Everything Query2 contract, Smart Actions evaluation, Diagnostics owner-draw routing and Classic 420/16/10 geometry.
- Updated Windows fixed version to 0.6.0.200.

## 0.6.0-beta.2

- Renamed the Settings Smart Actions runtime page from Actions / 操作 to Diagnostics / 诊断 so the label matches the page's actual purpose.
- Fixed the blank selected sidebar item by adding the Diagnostics owner-draw control ID to the WM_DRAWITEM navigation dispatch path.
- Renamed the page/router identifiers from Actions to Diagnostics to keep internal UI terminology aligned with the visible product language.
- Added release-contract checks that require the Diagnostics ID in both DrawNavigationButton and WM_DRAWITEM dispatch, preventing this blank-label regression.
- Kept v0.6 feature-freeze contracts unchanged: settings schemaVersion 4, provider-cache schemaVersion 2, frozen provider defaults, Hotkey Registry IDs and Smart Actions execution behavior.
- Updated Windows fixed version to 0.6.0.101.

## 0.6.0-beta.1

- Entered v0.6 feature freeze: no new provider, Smart Action family or persisted behavior toggle is introduced in beta.1.
- Added the ActionEvaluation contract so contextual Smart Actions expose availability plus a concrete unavailable reason while preserving existing execution/fallback semantics.
- Added a dedicated Actions / 操作 Settings page for Smart Actions capability and runtime diagnostics.
- Surface the last captured Windows activation context, Explorer/Total Commander folder context, TC active panel, file-dialog state, {folder} availability and current-file-manager navigation availability.
- Surface Everything IPC availability/fallback state on the Actions diagnostics page without changing the external optional Everything contract.

- Expanded Launcher Action Policy regression coverage for file-dialog navigation, unsupported file-manager contexts, non-folder navigation intents, empty copy targets and invalid action targets.
- Expanded Windows runtime smoke coverage to Total Commander right-panel selection plus UNC, spaces and Unicode paths.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 4, commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2, frozen provider defaults, Hotkey Registry IDs and Classic geometry 420/16/10 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed version to 0.6.0.100.

## 0.6.0-alpha.6.1

- Hardened schema-3 -> 4 Hotkey Registry migration when an existing user global activation chord collides with a newly introduced launcher-local default.
- Preserve established primary/auxiliary global bindings; disable the conflicting new optional local action instead of creating duplicate enabled chords.
- Seed schema-4 Registry globals from the legacy compatibility mirror before applying hotkeys.bindings, improving recovery from partial schema-4 documents.
- Added Config Core regression coverage for a legacy primary F2 binding colliding with the new Open Settings default.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 4, stable Hotkey Registry action IDs, commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2, provider defaults and Classic geometry unchanged.

- Kept primary activation mandatory and modifier-protected.
- Preserved transactional Windows RegisterHotKey behavior: failed global rebinds restore the previous working binding.
- Upgraded settings.json to schemaVersion 4 and added hotkeys.bindings.
- Migrated schema-3 primary/auxiliary bindings into the registry while supplying published defaults for launcher-local actions.
- Retained the legacy hotkey object as a compatibility mirror so alpha.5 downgrade reads known global fields but leaves schema 4 read-only and byte-identical.
- Added portable Hotkey Registry regression tests and extended current/Windows 10 CI lanes.
- Moved hotkey editing out of General Settings; General now focuses on launcher behavior, search and placement.
- Kept commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2, provider IDs/defaults and Classic geometry 420/16/10 unchanged.

## 0.6.0-alpha.5

- Added CopyText as a reusable Smart Action kind.
- Added runtime-only builtin.clipboard provider without changing Search Sources or persisted provider defaults.
- Added explicit copy / clip / 复制 text actions that copy the remainder of the launcher query instead of executing it.
- Added Ctrl+Shift+C to copy the currently selected result target/path/resolved URL while preserving normal Ctrl+C query-text behavior.
- Copy-selected execution is fail-safe: the copy intent never falls through to launching the selected command when no payload exists.
- Added Unicode Win32 clipboard writing through CF_UNICODETEXT with short retry handling for temporary clipboard contention.
- Clipboard actions do not read or persist previous clipboard contents.
- Added localized Copy text / copy-failure strings.

- Updated Windows fixed version to 0.6.0.50.

## 0.6.0-alpha.4

- Added Total Commander 9+ as a runtime Activation Context without introducing a provider or hard dependency.
- Capture the exact foreground TTOTAL_CMD window, process ID, active panel and filesystem folder when available.
- Added NavigateTotalCommander to the Smart Action contract and generalized Ctrl+Enter intent to NavigateCurrentFileManager while preserving the previous NavigateCurrentExplorer alias.
- Ctrl+Enter on a Folder result now navigates the captured Total Commander active/source panel.
- Use Total Commander's WM_USER+50 active-panel/path-control queries and WM_COPYDATA CD protocol; Unicode target paths are sent as UTF-8 with BOM.
- Revalidate the exact captured TC window/process/active panel before navigation, so multiple instances and stale contexts are not guessed.
- Added {folder} templates for User Command Target, Arguments and Working Directory.
- Resolve {folder} from a real Explorer filesystem path or Total Commander active-panel filesystem path without mutating commands.json.
- Contextual commands are excluded from search when the activation context has no real filesystem folder; no empty, stale or guessed fallback is substituted.
- {folder} is resolved before {query} web-action generation, allowing deliberate combinations in URL commands.
- Added portable CommandTemplate regression tests and a fake-TOTAL_CMD Windows runtime smoke that validates active-panel capture and WM_COPYDATA navigation without installing Total Commander in CI.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 3, commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2, provider defaults and Classic geometry 420/16/10 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed version to 0.6.0.40.

## 0.6.0-alpha.3

- Added Windows Activation Context detection for standard Open / Save / folder-picker dialogs.
- Added NavigateFileDialog to the Smart Action contract.
- Folder results now navigate the captured file dialog on normal Enter/default execution instead of opening another Explorer window.
- Preserved Explorer semantics: Enter opens normally and Ctrl+Enter navigates the captured Explorer.
- Limited file-dialog recognition to #32770 roots that host SHELLDLL_DefView so ordinary dialogs are not mistaken for file pickers.
- Revalidate the captured dialog HWND and process ID immediately before navigation.
- File-dialog navigation uses the standard Ctrl+L address surface plus Unicode SendInput; it does not use the clipboard or overwrite the File name field.
- Refuse keyboard injection unless the captured dialog actually regains foreground, protecting against stale context and foreground/UIPI failures.
- File results remain unchanged; alpha 3 only adds Folder navigation.
- Extended Launcher Action Policy regression coverage for file-dialog/default and Ctrl+Enter behavior.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 3, commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2, provider defaults and Classic geometry 420/16/10 unchanged.
- Updated Windows fixed version to 0.6.0.30.

## 0.6.0-alpha.2.1

- Fixed Ctrl+Enter Explorer navigation when ALTRun Next is invoked from Home / 主文件夹, This PC, Quick access, Network or another virtual Shell namespace location.
- Changed Explorer source-context validity from "active Shell view plus filesystem source path" to "active Shell view"; only the destination Folder result still requires a filesystem path.
- Kept the source filesystem path as optional session-only diagnostic data when one exists.
- Preserved focused-view/visible-view/single-candidate selection and the no-guess ambiguity policy for Windows 11 tabs and multiple Explorer windows.
- Added release-contract protection so future changes cannot accidentally make Explorer source validity depend on explorerFolder again.
- Extended version tooling to support alpha hotfix versions such as alpha.2.1; Windows fixed version for this build is 0.6.0.21.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 3, commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2, provider defaults and Classic geometry 420/16/10 unchanged.

## 0.6.0-alpha.2

- Added per-launch Activation Context capture before ALTRun Next takes foreground focus.
- Added Windows Explorer context discovery through IShellWindows, IShellBrowser, active IShellView and filesystem PIDL resolution instead of title/address-bar scraping.
- Added conservative Explorer candidate selection using focused shell view, unique visible view, then single-candidate fallback; ambiguous multi-tab/multi-window states are never guessed.
- Added NavigateExplorer to the Smart Action contract and NavigateCurrentExplorer as an execution intent.
- Added Ctrl+Enter for Everything Folder results: navigate the captured Explorer to the selected folder.
- Kept Enter, double-click, numeric quick launch and single-result execution on their existing normal-open behavior.
- Made Ctrl+Enter fall back to normal folder opening when the launcher was invoked without an Explorer context.
- Refuse to redirect a different Explorer when the captured browser/view can no longer be resolved.
- Return focus to the captured Explorer after a successful navigation.
- Added portable action-policy and Explorer ambiguity-policy regression tests.
- Added Win32 Windows-context runtime smoke and run it on both current-Windows and Windows 10 API-baseline CI.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 3, commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2, provider defaults and Classic geometry 420/16/10 unchanged.
- Deferred {folder} command templates, Open/Save dialogs and Total Commander to later v0.6 phases.
- Updated Windows version metadata to 0.6.0-alpha.2 / 0.6.0.2.

## 0.6.0-alpha.1

- Added UTF-8 percent encoding for web-search query text, including Unicode/Chinese input.
- Suppressed the unresolved URL-template command when its resolved smart action is active.
- Kept ordinary URL commands without {query} unchanged.
- Recorded usage against the source user command after a generated web-search action launches successfully.
- Routed web actions through unified ranking and the existing Enter/double-click/numeric/single-result execution path.
- Made Everything File/Folder actions populate the new explicit action payload while preserving their existing behavior.
- Added portable regression coverage for direct URLs, www. normalization, aliases, empty queries, Unicode encoding and non-HTTP template rejection.
- Added the new web-action test to current-Windows and Windows 10 API-baseline CI.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 3, commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2 and Classic geometry 420/16/10 unchanged.
- Updated Windows version metadata to 0.6.0-alpha.1 / 0.6.0.1.

## 0.5.0

- Promoted the frozen v0.5.0 RC3 code line to Stable without adding new launcher behavior.
- Shipped native external Everything File/Folder search with unified User Command/Application/Folder/File ranking and dynamic recovery/fallback.
- Kept Everything disabled by default and retained the Unicode Query2/WM_COPYDATA transport, unnamed-first endpoint selection and conservative unique-named-instance fallback.
- Stabilized settings schemaVersion 3 with atomic v0.4.1 schema-2 migration and newer-schema downgrade read-only protection; commands/usage remain schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache remains schemaVersion 2.
- Retained the RC3 Settings polish: 54-logical-pixel owner-draw rows, single-line shortcut-editor labels, width-aware actions, separated Everything diagnostics/onboarding and owner-drawn sidebar navigation.
- Preserved Classic Launcher geometry at 420 logical px width, 16 logical px row height and 10 visible results.

- Aligned General card content gutters with the common Settings page header gutters.
- Added explicit DPI regression assertions for the polished row height and 38/34 logical content insets at 100/125/150/200%.
- Made shortcut-editor field labels single-line and widened the label column so Chinese aliases/working-directory labels no longer wrap into adjacent fields.
- Reworked shortcut-editor option and action rows to derive widths from available field space instead of fixed absolute positions.
- Matched edit and browse-control heights for cleaner field alignment.
- Reworked Search Sources vertical spacing so Everything diagnostics, onboarding actions and explanatory text no longer overlap.
- Unified Search Sources toggle rows with the same polished owner-draw row metric.
- Raised the Settings minimum width to 960 logical pixels for bilingual layout stability while preserving work-area clamping.
- Replaced native boxed sidebar buttons/text bullets with owner-drawn navigation using a subtle selected background, accent bar and semibold active-page text.
- Preserved Classic Launcher 420/16/10 geometry, settings schemaVersion 3, commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2 and the frozen Everything Query2 transport.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.5.0-rc.3` / `0.5.0.202`.


## 0.5.0-rc.2

- Replaced the confusing raw `ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND (2)` primary Everything diagnosis with explicit “Everything not detected” onboarding when no IPC endpoint exists.

- Froze settings schemaVersion 3, commands/usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2.
- Froze provider IDs and safe defaults, including `everything.filesystem=false`.
- Froze the beta.2 Everything compatibility baseline: unnamed-first endpoint selection, unique named-instance fallback, multi-instance ambiguity fallback, Query2 WM_COPYDATA and no Everything DLL/named-pipe dependency.
- Added `docs/V0.5_RC_VALIDATION.md` as the stable-promotion checklist for Windows 10/11, Everything 1.4/1.5, migration/downgrade, mixed DPI, IME, paths, soak and package validation.
- Added `V0.5_RC_VALIDATION.md` and `EVERYTHING_COMPATIBILITY.md` to both portable release ZIPs and the exact package allowlist.
- Kept all real-desktop validation items intentionally unchecked until manually observed.
- Limited post-RC changes to regression, compatibility, data-safety and publication/package fixes.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.5.0-rc.1` / `0.5.0.200`.


## 0.5.0-beta.2

- Added conservative Everything named-instance discovery using the documented `EVERYTHING_TASKBAR_NOTIFICATION_(instance)` class convention.
- Preserved unnamed/default-instance precedence; a named instance is auto-selected only when exactly one candidate exists.
- Added explicit ambiguous-multiple-instance fallback so ALTRun Next never silently chooses an arbitrary Everything database.
- Exposed the active IPC window class, named-instance fallback state and ambiguous candidate count in Search Sources diagnostics.
- Added sender-HWND validation for LIST2 replies to ignore spoofed or unrelated WM_COPYDATA responses.
- Added a 16 MiB default reply-payload guard and requested-result-count enforcement before accepting dynamic results.
- Hardened LIST2 parsing against item-count/total-count and offset-range inconsistencies.
- Preserved the Everything drive/root flag and normalized drive roots without manufacturing a misleading parent path.

- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.5.0-beta.2` / `0.5.0.101`.


## 0.5.0-beta.1

- Promoted `everything.filesystem` into the supported Settings > Search sources surface while keeping it disabled by default.
- Bumped `settings.json` to schemaVersion 3; commands/usage remain schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache remains schemaVersion 2.
- Added atomic schema-2 -> schema-3 migration tracking and regression coverage.
- Preserved the alpha experimental `everything.filesystem: true` opt-in during migration; schema-2 files without the key migrate with Everything disabled.
- Added an explicit schema-3 -> schema-2 downgrade regression proving the newer settings document remains byte-for-byte unchanged under read-only compatibility protection.
- Added live Everything diagnostics to Search Sources: current IPC availability, last query status, returned/total matches, latency and native Windows error.
- Added a one-second diagnostics refresh while Search Sources is visible plus immediate refresh after a dynamic query completes.
- Added clear application-search fallback status when Everything is enabled but IPC is unavailable.
- Added same-client unavailable -> available recovery coverage so starting/restarting Everything does not require restarting ALTRun Next.
- Kept standard Everything as an external dependency: no auto-start, no bundled Everything executable/DLL and no Everything Lite IPC workaround.
- Kept Everything File/Folder results out of provider-cache and usage persistence.
- Preserved the alpha.3 unified ranking, execution behavior and frozen Classic launcher geometry.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.5.0-beta.1` / `0.5.0.100`.


## 0.5.0-alpha.3

- Replaced the alpha.2 static-first append policy with unified ranking across User Command, Application, Folder and File results.
- Added a portable `ResultRanking` layer with dynamic filename/stem/path match scoring plus conservative kind/provider weights.
- Kept existing static SearchEngine scores as the primary ranking signal so mature command/app relevance, usage and pinning behavior remain intact.
- Added three-times-visible candidate depth for both static and Everything queries before final de-duplication/ranking.
- Kept static commands authoritative for duplicate targets so an Everything copy of the same executable/file path does not replace a richer application result.
- Added deterministic tie breaking by match score, result kind, provider and title.
- Added Classic folder presentation with a trailing backslash while preserving the frozen width, row height and result count.
- Changed File/Folder preview text to show the direct target path without the command prefix.
- Made numeric quick launch operate on the final unified result order, including File and Folder results.
- Made single-result immediate execution dynamic-aware: defer while the current Everything query is pending, then evaluate the settled merged result set once.
- Cancels deferred single-result execution when the launcher hides or the user manually executes a result, preventing late dynamic replies from triggering a second launch.
- Added portable ranking/merger tests and extended EverythingProvider runtime assertions to require a nonzero dynamic rank score.
- Kept Everything default-off, settings schemaVersion 2, commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2, Classic geometry and no-Everything-DLL packaging unchanged.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.5.0-alpha.3` / `0.5.0.3`.

- Added the generic `DynamicQueryProvider` contract and fixed dynamic provider ID `everything.filesystem`.
- Added `EverythingProvider` to translate query-time Everything IPC File/Folder items into unified launcher results.
- Added UI-thread handoff for asynchronous dynamic responses with generation validation on top of the IPC client's stale-reply protection.
- Kept static User Command/Application search synchronous and non-blocking; dynamic Everything results arrive later and rebuild the visible result list.
- Added a conservative alpha.2 result merger: static results first, dynamic results appended into remaining slots, target de-duplication performed case-insensitively.
- File rows render file name + parent path in the existing Classic columns; long text keeps the existing ellipsis behavior without changing Classic geometry.
- Added unified execution: static commands keep their existing execution path, Files open with the default Windows application, and Folders open through Shell/Explorer.
- Kept dynamic File/Folder results ephemeral and out of provider-cache/usage persistence.
- Kept Everything disabled by default; alpha testers can explicitly opt in with `providers["everything.filesystem"] = true` in `data/settings.json`.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 2 and deferred the formal schemaVersion 3 / Settings UI integration to the later Settings phase.
- Suppressed single-result immediate execution while dynamic search is enabled; mixed-result immediate-execution policy remains an alpha.3 task.
- Added portable result-merger regression tests and extended real WM_COPYDATA runtime coverage through `EverythingProvider` result mapping.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.5.0-alpha.2` / `0.5.0.2`.


## 0.5.0-alpha.1

- Added a portable Everything Query2 protocol layer for native Unicode `WM_COPYDATA` IPC without an Everything DLL dependency.
- Added Query2 request encoding for name/path/full-path fields and defensive LIST2 parsing with bounds, offset, UTF-16 terminator and request-flag validation.
- Added the Windows `EverythingIpcClient` with a dedicated worker thread and hidden reply window.
- Added 70 ms latest-query debounce, per-query reply tokens, generation-based stale-result discard, bounded send timeout and reply timeout handling.
- Added availability detection and graceful `Unavailable` behavior when the Everything IPC window is missing or IPC is unsupported, including Everything Lite behavior.
- Added query/result foundation types for File/Folder, latency, total matches and native error reporting.
- Added portable protocol tests covering Unicode/Chinese payloads and malformed IPC buffers.
- Added Windows fake-Everything runtime tests using real HWND + `WM_COPYDATA` messaging for success, unavailable fallback, stale reply discard, rapid typing coalescing and reply timeout.
- Added Everything IPC runtime smoke coverage to both current-Windows and Windows 10 API-baseline CI.
- Added an alpha.1 release contract that keeps settings schemaVersion 2, commands/usage schemaVersion 1, provider-cache schemaVersion 2, existing provider IDs and frozen Classic geometry unchanged.
- Kept `everything.filesystem`, LauncherResult integration, settings schemaVersion 3, provider-cache/usage persistence and Launcher file rendering out of alpha.1 by design.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.5.0-alpha.1` / `0.5.0.1`.


## 0.4.1

- Promoted the frozen v0.4.1 RC1 feature set to Stable without adding new launcher behavior.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 2, commands/usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.

- Retained responsive/scrollable General Settings layout and high-DPI work-area clamping.
- Retained tag/VERSION preflight, Release-mode assertion integrity, real RegisterHotKey smoke, Windows 10 API-baseline validation, exact ZIP allowlisting, x64 packaged-runtime startup smoke and SHA256 self-verification.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.4.1` / `0.4.1.300`.
- Kept `DESKTOP_VALIDATION.md` as the explicit manual Windows desktop QA record without fabricating unchecked observations.


## 0.4.1-rc.1

- Entered the v0.4.1 release-candidate phase with the feature set, schemas, provider IDs and Classic geometry still frozen.
- Added `scripts/verify_tag_version.py` so a tag-triggered release is rejected unless the pushed tag exactly matches `v` + `VERSION`.
- Added a dedicated Release preflight job so tag/version/metadata/freeze-contract failures occur before expensive Windows build jobs start.
- Added main-CI coverage proving the tag guard accepts the current version tag and rejects an intentionally mismatched tag.
- Added checksum self-verification with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt` to both main automatic publication and tag-triggered publication.

- Forced assertion-based C++ test targets to keep `assert()` active in Release CI builds by undefining `NDEBUG`.
- Added a compile-time guard proving the desktop validation target cannot silently run with assertions disabled.
- Extracted Classic numeric quick-launch mapping and single-result immediate-execution gating into portable helpers used by the production LauncherWindow.
- Added portable regression coverage for both numeric orders and single-result gating during IME composition, empty queries, disabled behavior and multiple results.
- Extracted General Settings layout calculation and work-area clamping into a portable helper used by the production SettingsWindow.
- Added automated layout coverage at 100%, 125%, 150% and 200% DPI for wide, stacked, compact and scrollable General-page states.
- Clamped `WM_DPICHANGED` suggested Settings geometry to the destination monitor work area.
- Capped Settings minimum tracking dimensions to the current monitor work area on high-DPI/small-display configurations.
- Added a real Windows `RegisterHotKey` runtime smoke covering duplicate conflict detection, unregister/re-register and a modified no-repeat binding.
- Expanded both current-Windows and Windows 10 API-baseline smoke jobs with desktop-validation and hotkey-runtime tests.
- Added a representative v0.4.0 -> v0.4.1 settings migration regression preserving existing preferences and applying safe schema-2 defaults.

- Kept Classic launcher geometry frozen.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.4.1-beta.2` / `0.4.1.101`.


## 0.4.1-beta.1

- Entered v0.4.1 feature freeze; Beta/RC work is limited to regressions, compatibility and release validation.
- Added scripts/verify_release_contract.py to lock the v0.4.1 settings/commands/usage/provider-cache schema versions, stable provider IDs, safe default settings and core Classic geometry.
- Added docs/DESKTOP_VALIDATION.md with a repeatable real Windows 10/11 desktop matrix covering 100%/125%/150%/200% DPI, hotkey lifecycle, IME, Classic search behavior, provider refresh, migration/downgrade and final release assets.
- Added scripts/verify_runtime_smoke.ps1 and an x64 final-ZIP startup smoke that validates the packaged executable can enter its portable runtime loop without crashing and leaves no writeability-probe residue.
- Added DESKTOP_VALIDATION.md to x64/ARM64 release packages and made it part of the package contract.
- Upgraded the tag-triggered Release workflow to require Core Tests, the v0.4.1 freeze contract, Windows provider/hotkey smoke tests and the Windows 10 API compatibility gate before release publication.
- Kept main automatic publication and manual/external v* tag publication aligned on the same release-safety gates.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 2, commands/usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Kept the Classic launcher feature set and visual geometry frozen.
- Updated Windows version metadata to 0.4.1-beta.1 / 0.4.1.100.


## 0.4.1-alpha.3

- Hardened the v0.4.1 Settings/behavior feature set without adding a new launcher feature surface.
- Changed Settings-open hotkey validation to retry only missing registrations instead of unregistering/re-registering bindings that are already working.
- Kept resume handling as a forced hotkey revalidation and refresh Settings registration status after repair.
- Fixed Restore defaults when the auxiliary hotkey occupies the default primary `Alt + Space`: the auxiliary binding is released first, and failures roll back the previous configuration.
- Suppressed single-result immediate execution during active IME composition so intermediate CJK input cannot trigger an unintended launch.
- Suppressed repeated Classic numeric quick-launch execution from keyboard auto-repeat.
- Reset stale IME-composition state whenever the launcher is shown.
- Made the General Settings page vertically scrollable when its content exceeds the current client area.
- Added responsive General-page behavior: launcher/search cards stack on narrow windows and hotkey controls use a compact wrapped layout.
- Clamped the Settings window to the active monitor work area so high-DPI scaling cannot center an oversized window partly off-screen.
- Restored the Settings minimum height to the pre-alpha.2 value now that General can scroll.
- Added Windows hotkey codec smoke coverage for `Pause/Break`, zero-modifier auxiliary bindings, modifier aliases and `MOD_NOREPEAT`.
- Added Config Core regression coverage for numeric quick-launch order preservation and invalid-order canonicalization.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 2, commands/usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.4.1-alpha.3` / `0.4.1.3`.


## 0.4.1-alpha.2

- Added Settings UI for the v0.4.1 Classic-behavior core without changing the frozen Classic launcher geometry.
- Added a show-on-startup toggle to General settings.
- Added a Search behavior card with toggles for `*` / `?` wildcard matching, Classic numeric quick launch and single-result immediate execution.
- Added a number-order selector for Classic quick launch: `1–9, 0` or `0–9`; the selector is disabled while numeric quick launch is off.
- Added full auxiliary-hotkey UI with enable/disable, Ctrl/Alt/Shift/Win modifiers, key selection, Apply action and independent registration/error status.
- Added `Pause` to the visible key selector so the default auxiliary binding can be configured without editing JSON.
- Kept auxiliary hotkeys transactional: a Windows registration conflict restores the previous working binding and refreshes the controls.
- Reorganized the General page into two behavior cards plus primary/auxiliary hotkey rows and launcher placement, while preserving the existing Settings Shell navigation.
- Updated the About description and settings documentation for the Classic-settings parity phase.
- Kept settings schemaVersion 2, commands/usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged from alpha.1.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.4.1-alpha.2` / `0.4.1.2`.


## 0.4.1-alpha.1

- Started the Classic-settings parity phase without changing the frozen Classic launcher geometry.
- Split configuration compatibility by document: settings.json moves to schemaVersion 2 while commands.json and usage.json remain schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache.json remains schemaVersion 2.
- Added atomic schema-1 -> schema-2 settings migration so v0.4.0 downgrades enter read-only compatibility mode instead of dropping new preferences.
- Added show-on-startup state with a default of disabled.
- Added an optional auxiliary global hotkey with an independent Windows hotkey ID, transactional registration/rollback and resume repair; the default auxiliary binding is bare Pause and remains disabled until enabled.
- Added Pause/Break support to the hotkey key-name codec.
- Added opt-in * / ? glob matching across keyword, aliases, title and target while preserving the existing fuzzy/pinyin path for normal queries.
- Added Classic numeric quick execution for top-ten results with selectable 1–9,0 or 0–9 ordering.
- Added optional immediate execution when a non-empty user query has exactly one result.
- Kept every new behavior disabled by default so upgrading from v0.4.0 does not change launcher interaction until the user opts in.
- Updated settings.example.json and CONFIG_SCHEMA.md for settings schemaVersion 2.
- Added Config Core migration/persistence coverage and SearchEngine wildcard regression coverage.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.4.1-alpha.1` / `0.4.1.1`.

- Stable and rolling releases include `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- Kept user-data schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged from RC1.
- Updated release metadata to `0.4.0` and Windows fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion to `0.4.0.300`.


## 0.4.0-rc.1

- Entered the v0.4 release-candidate phase with the discovery feature set frozen.
- Added startup writeability probing for the portable `data/` directory and a localized warning when settings cannot be persisted safely.
- Added per-store recovery state for `settings.json`, `commands.json` and `usage.json` when Config Core self-heals from a valid `.bak`.
- Extended the Data-page health notice to report recovered files, newer-schema read-only files and an unwritable data directory.
- Added regression coverage proving settings, commands and usage recovery state remains visible after the primary JSON file is repaired.
- Added a generated `Version.hpp` so the About page derives its version directly from the root `VERSION` file instead of a duplicated literal.
- Added `scripts/verify_version.py` to gate releases on consistent VERSION, CMake base version, Windows resource metadata, manifest version, README and CHANGELOG.
- Added post-package contract validation for required portable files, unexpected DLLs, packaged VERSION and EXE FileVersion/ProductVersion.
- Corrected the Windows VERSIONINFO resource include/constants so the embedded fixed FileVersion/ProductVersion is exposed through the standard Windows version APIs instead of appearing as 0.0.0.0.
- Added `SHA256SUMS.txt` to rolling and immutable GitHub releases.
- Kept user-data schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.4.0-rc.1`.

- Added schema-aware JSON loading with explicit primary, backup-recovery and unsupported-schema states.
- Added downgrade-safe read-only compatibility for `settings.json`, `commands.json` and `usage.json`.
- Newer-schema documents continue to expose known fields when possible, but all writes are blocked so an older binary cannot destroy newer data.
- Added a Data-page compatibility warning listing each read-only file and its unsupported schema version.
- Made settings appearance/general writes transactional instead of leaving in-memory state changed after a failed save.
- Made usage-history recording transactional and disabled it while usage data is in newer-schema read-only mode.
- Added Provider Cache validation that rejects commands stored under a provider ID that does not match the command source.
- Future provider-cache schemas are treated as disposable generated state and rebuilt rather than interpreted by an older binary.
- Expanded migration tests across all 16 provider-enable combinations, alpha-era settings without provider keys, backup self-healing, future settings/commands/usage schemas, provider/source mismatches and alpha.2 cache migration.
- Added a Windows Provider Registry runtime smoke executable covering stable IDs, enable/disable isolation, targeted discovery and change-token behavior.
- Added provider runtime smoke CI on both `windows-latest` and `windows-2022`; versioned releases now require both smoke gates in addition to Core Tests, x64, ARM64 and the Windows 10 API baseline.
- Kept settings/commands/usage schemaVersion 1 and provider-cache schemaVersion 2 unchanged.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.4.0-beta.2`.


## 0.4.0-beta.1

- Extracted provider/user command de-duplication from `CommandStore` into a portable, independently testable `CommandMerge` core module.
- Made provider precedence explicit and deterministic: user shortcuts > Start Menu > Windows Apps > App Paths > PATH.
- Preserved explicit duplicate user shortcuts while suppressing automatic duplicates by normalized target or normalized name + keyword.
- Added dedicated command-merge regression tests for user authority, provider priority, path normalization, semantic duplicate detection, distinct-entry preservation and disabled entries.
- Changed `CommandStore` to retain raw enabled provider cache entries until the merge stage, making de-duplication statistics accurate.

- Added current-session provider refresh diagnostics including last attempt time, success/failure state and provider error text.
- Added a Windows 10 API compile baseline with `_WIN32_WINNT=0x0A00` and `WINVER=0x0A00`.
- Added a separate `windows-2022` x64 compatibility build and made it a required gate for rolling/versioned releases.
- Kept provider-cache schemaVersion 2 and settings schemaVersion 1 unchanged; no user-data migration is required from v0.4 alpha releases.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.4.0-beta.1`.


## 0.4.0-alpha.4

- Added lightweight change tokens to Start Menu, Windows Apps, App Paths and PATH providers.
- Added a low-frequency provider monitor that detects source changes without blocking the launcher UI.
- Added targeted provider refresh so a changed source no longer forces unrelated providers to rescan.
- Added 750 ms debounce scheduling to coalesce bursts of application-install/update changes.
- Added queued provider refresh requests when discovery is already running, preserving source-specific requests without falling back to a full rescan.
- Disabled providers are excluded from change-token monitoring as well as search results.
- Treat transient AppsFolder / COM enumeration failures as provider failures so the previous Windows Apps cache is retained instead of being replaced with an empty result set.
- Improved PATH discovery to observe process PATH plus current machine/user registry PATH values, allowing newly added PATH directories to be discovered without restarting ALTRun Next.
- Added provider runtime status in Settings: enabled state, cached command count and last successful cache refresh time.
- Manual **Rebuild program index** remains an explicit full refresh of all enabled providers.
- Added cross-platform ProviderFingerprint coverage to Config Core tests.

- Upgraded `provider-cache.json` to cache schema 2 with independent per-provider timestamps and command arrays.
- Added automatic in-memory migration from the flat v0.4.0-alpha.2 provider cache.
- Added provider-level failure isolation: successful providers update independently while failed providers retain their previous cached data.
- Added partial-refresh status reporting in Settings.
- Extended Config Core tests for provider defaults, settings persistence, schema-2 provider cache, user-command exclusion, backup recovery and alpha.2 cache migration.
- Rewrote the project roadmap to match the actual v0.2-v0.4 development history and the planned v0.5+ direction.

- Added a background provider refresh worker for Start Menu, App Paths, PATH and AppsFolder discovery.
- Provider results are written atomically and hot-reloaded on the UI thread after a successful background scan.
- Existing cached results remain searchable while discovery is in progress or if a refresh fails.
- Changed Data -> Rebuild program index into a non-blocking background refresh.
- Added Settings status feedback for background index refresh completion/failure without changing the Classic launcher layout.
- Made `WindowsAppProvider` initialize a COM apartment on the discovery thread before enumerating `FOLDERID_AppsFolder`.

- Added provider-specific command sources for App Paths, PATH and packaged applications.
- Added cross-provider de-duplication while keeping user-defined shortcuts authoritative.
- Existing Data -> Rebuild program index now rescans every provider, not only the Start Menu.
- Start Menu results retain a higher default search priority than raw PATH entries; packaged apps and App Paths participate without overriding explicit user keywords or aliases.
- No persistent provider cache is introduced yet; background caching and incremental refresh remain scheduled for later v0.4 alphas.
- Updated Windows version metadata to `0.4.0-alpha.1`.


## 0.3.0-alpha.2

- Added multi-token search so spaced queries such as `visual code` can match all requested terms across a command.

- Improved mixed Chinese/English abbreviation handling, including `微信 DevTools` -> `wxdt`.
- Kept explicit user keywords and aliases ranked above automatically derived initials and pinyin.
- Multi-token queries now require every query token to match before receiving the multi-token ranking bonus.
- Extended SearchEngine CI tests for hybrid pinyin, spaced pinyin, multi-word search, English initials and mixed Chinese/English initials.

- Added an in-memory pinyin-form cache so a Chinese field is converted only once per process.
- Pinyin conversion is attempted only for Latin/digit search queries and only for fields containing supported Han characters.

- Added runtime hotkey status to Settings: Registered / Not registered plus the Windows error code when available.
- Revalidates the configured hotkey when Settings opens and after Windows resumes from suspend.

## 0.2.0-beta.1

- Added configurable global launcher hotkeys instead of a hard-coded Alt+Space binding.
- Added Ctrl / Alt / Shift / Win modifier selection and common letter, number, function and navigation keys.

### alpha.5.49 follow-up — numeric intent and uninstall recovery

- Preserve bare-number quick launch while probing Everything for strong filename continuations on an independent IPC channel. Distinguish confirmed absence from unavailable/truncated/failed queries; cancel stale intents on editing/session changes.

- Fix the elevated uninstaller working-directory pointer lifetime, already-stopping services, process-exit races and ignored process wait timeouts.
- Clear read-only attributes on owned ordinary entries, unlink reparse points without traversing their targets, retain retry anchors until late cleanup and restore an uninstall recovery entry after partial failure.
- Add Windows production-EDIT/IPC and real filesystem uninstall regression coverage. Versions and data schemas remain unchanged.
